<h2>Chapter One</h2>
<p></p>
<p>It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the</p>
<p>Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.  I'm stupid</p>
<p>about executions.  The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and</p>
<p>that's all there was to read about in the papers--goggle-eyed headlines</p>
<p>staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty,</p>
<p>peanut-smelling mouth of every subway.  It had nothing to do with me,</p>
<p>but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive</p>
<p>all along your nerves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it must be the worst thing in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>New York was bad enough.  By nine in the morning the fake, country-wet</p>
<p>freshness that somehow seeped in overnight evaporated like the tail end</p>
<p>of a sweet dream.  Mirage-grey at the bottom of their granite canyons,</p>
<p>the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered,</p>
<p>and the dry, tindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I kept hearing about the Rosenbergs over the radio and at the office</p>
<p>till I couldn't get them out of my mind.  It was like the first time I</p>
<p>saw a cadaver.  For weeks afterwards, the cadaver's head--or what there</p>
<p>was left of it--floated up behind my eggs and bacon at breakfast and</p>
<p>behind the face of Buddy Willard, who was responsible for my seeing it</p>
<p>in the first place, and pretty soon I felt as though I were carrying</p>
<p>that cadaver's head around with me on a string, like some black,</p>
<p>noseless balloon stinking of vinegar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew something was wrong with me that summer, because all I could</p>
<p>think about was the Rosenbergs and how stupid I'd been to buy all those</p>
<p>uncomfortable, expensive clothes, hanging limp as fish in my closet,</p>
<p>and how all the little successes I'd totted up so happily at college</p>
<p>fizzled to nothing outside the slick marble and plate-glass fronts</p>
<p>along Madison Avenue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was supposed to be having the time of my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was supposed to be the envy of thousands of other college girls just</p>
<p>like me all over America who wanted nothing more than to be tripping</p>
<p>about in those same size seven patent leather shoes I'd bought in</p>
<p>Bloomingdale's one lunch hour with a black patent leather belt and</p>
<p>black patent leather pocket-book to match.  And when my picture came</p>
<p>out in the magazine the twelve of us were working on--drinking martinis</p>
<p>in a skimpy, imitation silver-lam√© bodice stuck on to a big, fat cloud</p>
<p>of white tulle, on some Starlight Roof, in the company of several</p>
<p>anonymous young men with all-American bone structures hired or loaned</p>
<p>for the occasion--everybody would think I must be having a real whirl.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Look what can happen in this country, they'd say.  A girl lives in some</p>
<p>out-of-the-way town for nineteen years, so poor she can't afford a</p>
<p>magazine, and then she gets a scholarship to college and wins a prize</p>
<p>here and a prize there and ends up steering New York like her own</p>
<p>private car.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Only I wasn't steering anything, not even myself.  I just bumped from</p>
<p>my hotel to work and to parties and from parties to my hotel and back</p>
<p>to work like a numb trolley-bus.  I guess I should have been excited</p>
<p>the way most of the other girls were, but I couldn't get myself to</p>
<p>react.  I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado</p>
<p>must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding</p>
<p>hullabaloo.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There were twelve of us at the hotel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had all won a fashion magazine contest, by writing essays and</p>
<p>stories and poems and fashion blurbs, and as prizes they gave us jobs</p>
<p>in New York for a month, expenses paid, and piles and piles of free</p>
<p>bonuses, like ballet tickets and passes to fashion shows and hair</p>
<p>stylings at a famous expensive salon and chances to meet successful</p>
<p>people in the field of our desire and advice about what to do with our</p>
<p>particular complexions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I still have the make-up kit they gave me, fitted out for a person with</p>
<p>brown eyes and brown hair: an oblong of brown mascara with a tiny</p>
<p>brush, and a round basin of blue eye-shadow just big enough to dab the</p>
<p>tip of your finger in, and three lipsticks ranging from red to pink,</p>
<p>all cased in the same little gilt box with a mirror on one side.  I</p>
<p>also have a white plastic sun-glasses case with coloured shells and</p>
<p>sequins and a green plastic starfish sewed on to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I realized we kept piling up these presents because it was as good as</p>
<p>free advertising for the firms involved, but I couldn't be cynical.  I</p>
<p>got such a kick out of all those free gifts showering on to us.  For a</p>
<p>long time afterwards I hid them away, but later, when I was all right</p>
<p>again, I brought them out, and I still have them around the house.  I</p>
<p>use the lipsticks now and then, and last week I cut the plastic</p>
<p>starfish off the sun-glasses case for the baby to play with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So there were twelve of us at the hotel, in the same wing on the same</p>
<p>floor in single rooms, one after the other, and it reminded me of my</p>
<p>dormitory at college.  It wasn't a proper hotel--I mean a hotel where</p>
<p>there are both men and women mixed about here and there on the same</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This hotel--the Amazon--was for women only, and they were mostly girls</p>
<p>my age with wealthy parents who wanted to be sure their daughters would</p>
<p>be living where men couldn't get at them and deceive them; and they</p>
<p>were all going to posh secretarial schools like Katy Gibbs, where they</p>
<p>had to wear hats and stockings and gloves to class, or they had just</p>
<p>graduated from places like Katy Gibbs and were secretaries to</p>
<p>executives and junior executives and simply hanging around in New York</p>
<p>waiting to get married to some career man or other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These girls looked awfully bored to me.  I saw them on the sun-roof,</p>
<p>yawning and painting their nails and trying to keep up their Bermuda</p>
<p>tans, and they seemed bored as hell.  I talked with one of them, and</p>
<p>she was bored with yachts and bored with flying around in aeroplanes</p>
<p>and bored with skiing in Switzerland at Christmas and bored with the</p>
<p>men in Brazil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Girls like that make me sick.  I'm so jealous I can't speak.  Nineteen</p>
<p>years, and I hadn't been out of New England except for this trip to New</p>
<p>York.  It was my first big chance, but here I was, sitting back and</p>
<p>letting it run through my fingers like so much water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess one of my troubles was Doreen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd never known a girl like Doreen before.  Doreen came from a society</p>
<p>girls' college down South and had bright white hair standing out in a</p>
<p>cotton candy fluff round her head and blue eyes like transparent agate</p>
<p>marbles, hard and polished and just about indestructible, and a mouth</p>
<p>set in a sort of perpetual sneer.  I don't mean a nasty sneer, but an</p>
<p>amused, mysterious sneer, as if all the people around her were pretty</p>
<p>silly and she could tell some good jokes on them if she wanted to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen singled me out right away.  She made me feel I was that much</p>
<p>sharper than the others, and she really was wonderfully funny.  She</p>
<p>used to sit next to me at the conference table, and when the visiting</p>
<p>celebrities were talking she'd whisper witty sarcastic remarks to me</p>
<p>under her breath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her college was so fashion-conscious, she said, that all the girls had</p>
<p>pocket-book covers made out of the same material as their dresses, so</p>
<p>each time they changed their clothes they had a matching pocket-book.</p>
<p>This kind of detail impressed me.  It suggested a whole life of</p>
<p>marvellous, elaborate decadence that attracted me like a magnet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only thing Doreen ever bawled me out about was bothering to get my</p>
<p>assignments in by a deadline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What are you sweating over that for?'  Doreen lounged on my bed in a</p>
<p>peach silk dressing-gown, filing her long, nicotine-yellow nails with</p>
<p>an emery board, while I typed up the draft of an interview with a</p>
<p>best-selling novelist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That was another thing--the rest of us had starched cotton summer</p>
<p>nighties and quilted housecoats, or maybe terry-towel robes that</p>
<p>doubled as beachcoats, but Doreen wore these full-length nylon and lace</p>
<p>jobs you could half see through, and dressing-gowns the colour of skin,</p>
<p>that stuck to her by some kind of electricity.  She had an interesting,</p>
<p>slightly sweaty smell that reminded me of those scallopy leaves of</p>
<p>sweet fern you break off and crush between your fingers for the musk of</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You know old Jay Cee won't give a damn if that story's in tomorrow or</p>
<p>Monday.'  Doreen lit a cigarette and let the smoke flare slowly from</p>
<p>her nostrils so her eyes were veiled.  'Jay Cee's ugly as sin,' Doreen</p>
<p>went on coolly.  'I bet that old husband of hers turns out all the</p>
<p>lights before he gets near her or he'd puke otherwise.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jay Cee was my boss, and I liked her a lot, in spite of what Doreen</p>
<p>said.  She wasn't one of the fashion magazine gushers with fake</p>
<p>eyelashes and giddy jewellery.  Jay Cee had brains, so her plug-ugly</p>
<p>looks didn't seem to matter.  She read a couple of languages and knew</p>
<p>all the quality writers in the business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to imagine Jay Cee out of her strict office suit and</p>
<p>luncheon-duty hat and in bed with her fat husband, but I just couldn't</p>
<p>do it.  I always had a terribly hard time trying to imagine people in</p>
<p>bed together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jay Cee wanted to teach me something, all the old ladies I ever knew</p>
<p>wanted to teach me something, but I suddenly didn't think they had</p>
<p>anything to teach me.  I fitted the lid on my typewriter and clicked it</p>
<p>shut.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen grinned.  'Smart girl.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somebody tapped at the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who is it?'  I didn't bother to get up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's me, Betsy.  Are you coming to the party?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I guess so.'  I still didn't go to the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They imported Betsy straight from Kansas with her bouncing blonde</p>
<p>pony-tail and Sweetheart-of-Sigma-Chi smile.  I remember once the two</p>
<p>of us were called over to the office of some blue-chinned TV producer</p>
<p>in a pin-stripe suit to see if we had any angles he could build up for</p>
<p>a programme, and Betsy started to tell about the male and female corn</p>
<p>in Kansas.  She got so excited about that damn corn even the producer</p>
<p>had tears in his eyes, only he couldn't use any of it, unfortunately,</p>
<p>he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Later on, the Beauty Editor persuaded Betsy to cut her hair and made a</p>
<p>cover girl out of her, and I still see her face now and then, smiling</p>
<p>out of those 'P.Q.'s wife wears B.H. Wragge' ads.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Betsy was always asking me to do things with her and the other girls as</p>
<p>if she were trying to save me in some way.  She never asked Doreen.  In</p>
<p>private, Doreen called her Pollyanna Cowgirl.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you want to come in our cab?' Betsy said through the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen shook her head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's all right, Betsy,' I said.  'I'm going with Doreen.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Okay.'  I could hear Betsy padding off down the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'We'll just go till we get sick of it,' Doreen told me, stubbing out</p>
<p>her cigarette in the base of my bedside reading-lamp, 'then we'll go</p>
<p>out on the town.  Those parties they stage here remind me of the old</p>
<p>dances in the school gym.  Why do they always round up Yalies?  They're</p>
<p>so stoo-pit!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy Willard went to Yale, but now I thought of it, what was wrong</p>
<p>with him was that he was stupid.  Oh, he'd managed to get good marks</p>
<p>all right, and to have an affair with some awful waitress on the Cape</p>
<p>by the name of Gladys, but he didn't have one speck of intuition.</p>
<p>Doreen had intuition.  Everything she said was like a secret voice</p>
<p>speaking straight out of my own bones.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We were stuck in the theatre-hour rush.  Our cab sat wedged in back of</p>
<p>Betsy's cab and in front of a cab with four of the other girls, and</p>
<p>nothing moved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen looked terrific.  She was wearing a strapless white lace dress</p>
<p>zipped up over a snug corset affair that curved her in at the middle</p>
<p>and bulged her out again spectacularly above and below, and her skin</p>
<p>had a bronzy polish under the pale dusting-powder.  She smelled strong</p>
<p>as a whole perfume store.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wore a black shantung sheath that cost me forty dollars.  It was part</p>
<p>of a buying spree I had with some of my scholarship money when I heard</p>
<p>I was one of the lucky ones going to New York.  This dress was cut so</p>
<p>queerly I couldn't wear any sort of a bra under it, but that didn't</p>
<p>matter much as I was skinny as a boy and barely rippled, and I liked</p>
<p>feeling almost naked on the hot summer nights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The city had faded my tan, though.  I looked yellow as a Chinaman.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, I would have been nervous about my dress and my odd colour,</p>
<p>but being with Doreen made me forget my worries.  I felt wise and</p>
<p>cynical as all hell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the man in the blue lumber shirt and black chinos and tooled</p>
<p>leather cowboy boots started to stroll over to us from under the</p>
<p>striped awning of the bar where he'd been eyeing our cab, I didn't have</p>
<p>any illusions.  I knew perfectly well he'd come for Doreen.  He</p>
<p>threaded his way out between the stopped cars and leaned engagingly on</p>
<p>the sill of our open window.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And what, may I ask, are two nice girls like you doing all alone in a</p>
<p>cab on a nice night like this?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He had a big, wide, white tooth-paste-ad smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'We're on our way to a party,' I blurted, since Doreen had gone</p>
<p>suddenly dumb as a post and was fiddling in a blas√© way with her white</p>
<p>lace pocket-book cover.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That sounds boring,' the man said.  'Whyn't you both join me for a</p>
<p>couple of drinks in that bar over there?  I've some friends waiting as</p>
<p>well.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He nodded in the direction of several informally dressed men slouching</p>
<p>around under the awning.  They had been following him with their eyes,</p>
<p>and when he glanced back at them, they burst out laughing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The laughter should have warned me.  It was a kind of low, know-it-all</p>
<p>snicker, but the traffic showed signs of moving again, and I knew that</p>
<p>if I sat tight, in two seconds I'd be wishing I'd taken this gift of a</p>
<p>chance to see something of New York besides what the people on the</p>
<p>magazine had planned out for us so carefully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How about it, Doreen?' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How about it, Doreen?' the man said, smiling his big smile.  To this</p>
<p>day I can't remember what he looked like when he wasn't smiling.  I</p>
<p>think he must have been smiling the whole time.  It must have been</p>
<p>natural for him, smiling like that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, all right,' Doreen said to me.  I opened the door, and we</p>
<p>stepped out of the cab just as it was edging ahead again and started to</p>
<p>walk over to the bar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a terrible shriek of brakes followed by a dull thump-thump.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey you!'  Our cabby was craning out of his window with a furious,</p>
<p>purple expression.  'Waddaya think you're doin'?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He had stopped the cab so abruptly that the cab behind bumped smack</p>
<p>into him, and we could see the four girls inside waving and struggling</p>
<p>and scrambling up off the floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The man laughed and left us on the kerb and went back and handed a bill</p>
<p>to the driver in the middle of a great honking and some yelling, and</p>
<p>then we saw the girls from the magazine moving off in a row, one cab</p>
<p>after another, like a wedding party with nothing but bridesmaids.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Come on, Frankie,' the man said to one of his friends in the group,</p>
<p>and a short, scrunty fellow detached himself and came into the bar with</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was the type of fellow I can't stand.  I'm five feet ten in my</p>
<p>stocking feet, and when I am with little men I stoop over a bit and</p>
<p>slouch my hips, one up and one down, so I'll look shorter, and I feel</p>
<p>gawky and morbid as somebody in a side-show.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute I had a wild hope we might pair off according to size,</p>
<p>which would line me up with the man who had spoken to us in the first</p>
<p>place, and he cleared a good six feet, but he went ahead with Doreen</p>
<p>and didn't give me a second look.  I tried to pretend I didn't see</p>
<p>Frankie dogging along at my elbow and sat close by Doreen at the table.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was so dark in the bar I could hardly make out anything except</p>
<p>Doreen.  With her white hair and white dress she was so white she</p>
<p>looked silver.  I think she must have reflected the neons over the bar.</p>
<p>I felt myself melting into the shadows like the negative of a person</p>
<p>I'd never seen before in my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, what'll we have?' the man asked with a large smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I think I'll have an Old-Fashioned,' Doreen said to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ordering drinks always floored me.  I didn't know whisky from gin and</p>
<p>never managed to get anything I really liked the taste of.  Buddy</p>
<p>Willard and the other college boys I knew were usually too poor to buy</p>
<p>hard liquor or they scorned drinking altogether.  It's amazing how many</p>
<p>college boys don't drink or smoke.  I seemed to know them all.  The</p>
<p>farthest Buddy Willard ever went was buying us a bottle of Dubonnet,</p>
<p>which he only did because he was trying to prove he could be √¶sthetic</p>
<p>in spite of being a medical student.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll have a vodka,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The man looked at me more closely.  'With anything?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Just plain,' I said.  'I always have it plain.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I might make a fool of myself by saying I'd have it with ice</p>
<p>or soda or gin or anything.  I'd seen a vodka ad once, just a glass</p>
<p>full of vodka standing in the middle of a snowdrift in a blue light,</p>
<p>and the vodka looked clear and pure as water, so I thought having vodka</p>
<p>plain must be all right.  My dream was some day ordering a drink and</p>
<p>finding out it tasted wonderful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The waiter came up then, and the man ordered drinks for the four of us.</p>
<p>He looked so at home in that citified bar in his ranch outfit I thought</p>
<p>he might well be somebody famous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen wasn't saying a word, she only toyed with her cork place-mat and</p>
<p>eventually lit a cigarette, but the man didn't seem to mind.  He kept</p>
<p>staring at her the way people stare at the great white macaw in the</p>
<p>zoo, waiting for it to say something human.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The drinks arrived, and mine looked clear and pure, just like the vodka</p>
<p>ad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you do?' I asked the man, to break the silence shooting up</p>
<p>around me on all sides, thick as jungle grass.  'I mean what do you do</p>
<p>here in New York?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Slowly and with what seemed a great effort, the man dragged his eyes</p>
<p>away from Doreen's shoulder.  'I'm a disc jockey,' he said.  'You</p>
<p>prob'ly must have heard of me.  The name's Lenny Shepherd.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I know you,' Doreen said suddenly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm glad about that, honey,' the man said, and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>'That'll come in handy.  I'm famous as hell.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Lenny Shepherd gave Frankie a long look.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Say, where do you come from?' Frankie asked, sitting up with a jerk.</p>
<p>'What's your name?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'This here's Doreen.'  Lenny slid his hand around Doreen's bare arm and</p>
<p>gave her a squeeze.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What surprised me was that Doreen didn't let on she noticed what he was</p>
<p>doing.  She just sat there, dusky as a bleached blonde negress in her</p>
<p>white dress and sipped daintily at her drink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My name's Elly Higginbottom,' I said.  'I come from Chicago.'  After</p>
<p>that I felt safer.  I didn't want anything I said or did that night to</p>
<p>be associated with me and my real name and coming from Boston.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, Elly, what do you say we dance some?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The thought of dancing with that little runt in his orange suede</p>
<p>elevator shoes and mingy T-shirt and droopy blue sports coat made me</p>
<p>laugh.  If there's anything I look down on, it's a man in a blue</p>
<p>outfit.  Black or grey, or brown, even.  Blue just makes me laugh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm not in the mood,' I said coldly, turning my back on him and</p>
<p>hitching my chair over nearer to Doreen and Lenny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those two looked as if they'd known each other for years by now.</p>
<p>Doreen was spooning up the hunks of fruit at the bottom of her glass</p>
<p>with a spindly silver spoon, and Lenny was grunting each time she</p>
<p>lifted the spoon to her mouth, and snapping and pretending to be a dog</p>
<p>or something, and trying to get the fruit off the spoon.  Doreen</p>
<p>giggled and kept spooning up the fruit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I began to think vodka was my drink at last.  It didn't taste like</p>
<p>anything, but it went straight down into my stomach like a</p>
<p>sword-swallower's sword and made me feel powerful and god-like.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I better go now,' Frankie said, standing up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't see him very clearly, the place was so dim, but for the</p>
<p>first time I heard what a high, silly voice he had.  Nobody paid him</p>
<p>any notice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey, Lenny, you owe me something.  Remember, Lenny, you owe me</p>
<p>something, don't you, Lenny?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it odd Frankie should be reminding Lenny he owed him</p>
<p>something in front of us, and we being perfect strangers, but Frankie</p>
<p>stood there saying the same thing over and over until Lenny dug into</p>
<p>his pocket and pulled out a big roll of green bills and peeled one off</p>
<p>and handed it to Frankie.  I think it was ten dollars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Shut up and scram.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute I thought Lenny was talking to me as well, but then I</p>
<p>heard Doreen say 'I won't come unless Elly comes'.  I had to hand it to</p>
<p>her the way she picked up my fake name.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, Elly'll come, won't you, Elly?' Lenny said, giving me a wink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Sure I'll come,' I said.  Frankie had wilted away into the night, so I</p>
<p>thought I'd string along with Doreen.  I wanted to see as much as I</p>
<p>could.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I liked looking on at other people in crucial situations.  If there was</p>
<p>a road accident or a street fight or a baby pickled in a laboratory jar</p>
<p>for me to look at, I'd stop and look so hard I never forgot it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I certainly learned a lot of things I never would have learned</p>
<p>otherwise this way, and even when they surprised me or made me sick I</p>
<p>never let on, but pretended that's the way I knew things were all the</p>
<p>time.</p>

<h2>Chapter Two</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I wouldn't have missed Lenny's place for anything.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was built exactly like the inside of a ranch, only in the middle of</p>
<p>a New York apartment house.  He'd had a few partitions knocked down to</p>
<p>make the place broaden out, he said, and then had them pine-panel the</p>
<p>walls and fit up a special pine-panelled bar in the shape of a</p>
<p>horseshoe.  I think the floor was pine-panelled, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Great white bearskins lay about underfoot, and the only furniture was a</p>
<p>lot of low beds covered with Indian rugs.  Instead of pictures hung up</p>
<p>on the walls, he had antlers and buffalo horns and a stuffed rabbit</p>
<p>head.  Lenny jutted a thumb at the meek little grey muzzle and stiff</p>
<p>jackrabbit ears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ran over that in Las Vegas.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He walked away across the room, his cowboy boots echoing like pistol</p>
<p>shots.  'Acoustics,' he said, and grew smaller and smaller until he</p>
<p>vanished through a door in the distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All at once music started to come out of the air on every side.  Then</p>
<p>it stopped, and we heard Lenny's voice say 'This is your twelve o'clock</p>
<p>disc jock, Lenny Shepherd, with a round-up of the tops in pops.  Number</p>
<p>Ten in the wagon train this week is none other than that little</p>
<p>yaller-haired gal you been hearin' so much about lately ... the one an'</p>
<p>only Sunflower?</p>
<p></p>
<p>_I was born in Kansas, I was bred in Kansas,</p>
<p>And when I marry I'll be wed in Kansas..._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'What a card!' Doreen said.  'Isn't he a card?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You bet,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Listen, Elly, do me a favour.'  She seemed to think Elly was who I</p>
<p>really was by now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Sure,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Stick around, will you?  I wouldn't have a chance if he tried anything</p>
<p>funny.  Did you see that muscle?'  Doreen giggled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lenny popped out of the back room.  'I got twenty grand's worth of</p>
<p>recording equipment in there.' He ambled over to the bar and set out</p>
<p>three glasses and a silver ice-bucket and a big pitcher and began to</p>
<p>mix drinks from several different bottles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>_...to a true-blue gal who promised she would wait--</p>
<p>She's the sunflower of the Sunflower State._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Terrific, huh?'  Lenny came over, balancing three glasses.  Big drops</p>
<p>stood out on them like sweat, and the ice-cubes jingled as he passed</p>
<p>them round.  Then the music twanged to a stop, and we heard Lenny's</p>
<p>voice announcing the next number.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nothing like listening to yourself talk.  Say,' Lenny's eye lingered</p>
<p>on me, 'Frankie vamoosed, you ought to have somebody, I'll call up one</p>
<p>of the fellers.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's okay,' I said.  'You don't have to do that.'  I didn't want to</p>
<p>come straight out and ask for somebody several sizes larger than</p>
<p>Frankie.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lenny looked relieved.  'Just so's you don't mind.  I wouldn't want to</p>
<p>do wrong by a friend of Doreen's.'  He gave Doreen a big white smile.</p>
<p>'Would I, honeybun?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He held out a hand to Doreen, and without a word they both started to</p>
<p>jitterbug, still hanging on to their glasses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat cross-legged on one of the beds and tried to look devout and</p>
<p>impassive like some businessmen I once saw watching an Algerian</p>
<p>belly-dancer, but as soon as I leaned back against the wall under the</p>
<p>stuffed rabbit, the bed started to roll out into the room, so I sat</p>
<p>down on a bearskin on the floor and leaned back against the bed instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My drink was wet and depressing.  Each time I took another sip it</p>
<p>tasted more and more like dead water.  Around the middle of the glass</p>
<p>there was painted a pink lasso with yellow polka dots.  I drank to</p>
<p>about an inch below the lasso and waited a bit, and when I went to take</p>
<p>another sip, the drink was up to lasso-level again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Out of the air Lenny's ghost voice boomed, '_Wye oh wye did I ever</p>
<p>leave Wyoming_?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The two of them didn't even stop jitterbugging during the intervals.  I</p>
<p>felt myself shrinking to a small black dot against all those red and</p>
<p>white rugs and that pine-panelling.  I felt like a hole in the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and</p>
<p>more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra</p>
<p>person in the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the</p>
<p>opposite direction--every second the city gets smaller and smaller,</p>
<p>only you feel it's really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier</p>
<p>and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and that excitement at</p>
<p>about a million miles an hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every so often Lenny and Doreen would bang into each other and kiss and</p>
<p>then swing back to take a long drink and close in on each other again.</p>
<p>I thought I might just lie down on the bearskin and go to sleep until</p>
<p>Doreen felt ready to go back to the hotel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Lenny gave a terrible roar.  I sat up.  Doreen was hanging on to</p>
<p>Lenny's left earlobe with her teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Leggo, you bitch!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lenny stooped, and Doreen went flying up on to his shoulder, and her</p>
<p>glass sailed out of her hand in a long, wide arc and fetched up against</p>
<p>the pine-panelling with a silly tinkle.  Lenny was still roaring and</p>
<p>whirling round so fast I couldn't see Doreen's face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I noticed, in the routine way you notice the colour of somebody's eyes,</p>
<p>that Doreen's breasts had popped out of her dress and were swinging out</p>
<p>slightly like full brown melons as she circled belly-down on Lenny's</p>
<p>shoulder, thrashing her legs in the air and screeching, and then they</p>
<p>both started to laugh and slow up, and Lenny was trying to bite</p>
<p>Doreen's hip through her skirt when I let myself out the door before</p>
<p>anything more could happen and managed to get downstairs by leaning</p>
<p>with both hands on the banister and half sliding the whole way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't realize Lenny's place had been air-conditioned until I wavered</p>
<p>out on to the pavement.  The tropical, stale heat the sidewalks had</p>
<p>been sucking up all day hit me in the face like a last insult.  I</p>
<p>didn't know where in the world I was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute I entertained the idea of taking a cab to the party after</p>
<p>all, but decided against it because the dance might be over by now, and</p>
<p>I didn't feel like ending up in an empty barn of a ballroom strewn with</p>
<p>confetti and cigarette-butts and crumpled cocktail napkins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I walked carefully to the nearest street corner, brushing the wall of</p>
<p>the buildings on my left with the tip of one finger to steady myself.</p>
<p>I looked at the street sign.  Then I took my New York street map out of</p>
<p>my pocket-book.  I was exactly forty-three blocks by five blocks away</p>
<p>from my hotel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Walking has never fazed me.  I just set out in the right direction,</p>
<p>counting the blocks under my breath, and when I walked into the lobby</p>
<p>of the hotel I was perfectly sober and my feet only slightly swollen,</p>
<p>but that was my own fault because I hadn't bothered to wear any</p>
<p>stockings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The lobby was empty except for a night clerk dozing in his lit booth</p>
<p>among the key-rings and the silent telephones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I slid into the self-service elevator and pushed the button for my</p>
<p>floor.  The doors folded shut like a noiseless accordion.  Then my ears</p>
<p>went funny, and I noticed a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring</p>
<p>idiotically into my face.  It was only me, of course.  I was appalled</p>
<p>to see how wrinkled and used-up I looked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There wasn't a soul in the hall.  I let myself into my room.  It was</p>
<p>full of smoke.  At first I thought the smoke had materialized out of</p>
<p>thin air as a sort of judgement, but then I remembered it was Doreen's</p>
<p>smoke and pushed the button that opened the window vent.  They had the</p>
<p>windows fixed so you couldn't really open them and lean out, and for</p>
<p>some reason this made me furious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By standing at the left side of the window and laying my cheek to the</p>
<p>woodwork, I could see downtown to where the UN balanced itself in the</p>
<p>dark, like a weird, green, Martian honeycomb.  I could see the moving</p>
<p>red and white lights along the drive and the lights of the bridges</p>
<p>whose names I didn't know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The silence depressed me.  It wasn't the silence of silence.  It was my</p>
<p>own silence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew perfectly well the cars were making a noise, and the people in</p>
<p>them and behind the lit windows of the buildings were making a noise,</p>
<p>and the river was making a noise, but I couldn't hear a thing.  The</p>
<p>city hung in my window, flat as a poster, glittering and blinking, but</p>
<p>it might just as well not have been there at all, for all the good it</p>
<p>did me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The china-white bedside telephone could have connected me up with</p>
<p>things, but there it sat, dumb as a death's head.  I tried to think of</p>
<p>people I'd given my phone number to, so I could make a list of all the</p>
<p>possible calls I might be about to receive, but all I could think of</p>
<p>was that I'd given my phone number to Buddy Willard's mother so she</p>
<p>could give it to a simultaneous interpreter she knew at the UN.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I let out a small, dry laugh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could imagine the sort of simultaneous interpreter Mrs Willard would</p>
<p>introduce me to when all the time she wanted me to marry Buddy, who was</p>
<p>taking the cure for TB somewhere in upper New York State.  Buddy's</p>
<p>mother had even arranged for me to be given a job as a waitress at the</p>
<p>TB sanatorium that summer so Buddy wouldn't be lonely.  She and Buddy</p>
<p>couldn't understand why I chose to go to New York City instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mirror over my bureau seemed slightly warped and much too silver.</p>
<p>The face in it looked like the reflection in a ball of dentist's</p>
<p>mercury.  I thought of crawling in between the bed-sheets and trying to</p>
<p>sleep, but that appealed to me about as much as stuffing a dirty,</p>
<p>scrawled-over letter into a fresh, clean envelope.  I decided to take a</p>
<p>hot bath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There must be quite a few things a hot bath won't cure, but I don't</p>
<p>know many of them.  Whenever I'm sad I'm going to die, or so nervous I</p>
<p>can't sleep, or in love with somebody I won't be seeing for a week, I</p>
<p>slump down just so far and then I say: 'I'll go take a hot bath.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I meditate in the bath.  The water needs to be very hot, so hot you can</p>
<p>barely stand putting your foot in it.  Then you lower yourself, inch by</p>
<p>inch, till the water's up to your neck.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remember the ceilings over every bathtub I've stretched out in.  I</p>
<p>remember the texture of the ceilings and the cracks and the colours and</p>
<p>the damp spots and the light fixtures.  I remember the tubs, too: the</p>
<p>antique griffin-legged tubs, and the modern coffin-shaped tubs, and the</p>
<p>fancy pink marble tubs overlooking indoor lily ponds, and I remember</p>
<p>the shapes and sizes of the water taps and the different sorts of</p>
<p>soap-holders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I never feel so much myself as when I'm in a hot bath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lay in that tub on the seventeenth floor of this hotel</p>
<p>for-women-only, high up over the jazz and push of New York, for near on</p>
<p>to an hour, and I felt myself growing pure again.  I don't believe in</p>
<p>baptism or the waters of Jordan or anything like that, but I guess I</p>
<p>feel about a hot bath the way those religious people feel about holy</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said to myself: 'Doreen is dissolving, Lenny Shepherd is dissolving,</p>
<p>Frankie is dissolving, New York is dissolving, they are all dissolving</p>
<p>away and none of them matter any more.  I don't know them, I have never</p>
<p>known them and I am very pure.  All that liquor and those sticky kisses</p>
<p>I saw and the dirt that settled on my skin on the way back is turning</p>
<p>into something pure.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The longer I lay there in the clear hot water the purer I felt, and</p>
<p>when I stepped out at last and wrapped myself in one of the big, soft,</p>
<p>white, hotel bath-towels I felt pure and sweet as a new baby.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know how long I had been asleep when I heard the knocking.  I</p>
<p>didn't pay any attention at first, because the person knocking kept</p>
<p>saying 'Elly, Elly, Elly, let me in', and I didn't know any Elly.  Then</p>
<p>another kind of knock sounded over the first dull, bumping knock--a</p>
<p>sharp tap-tap, and another, much crisper voice said 'Miss Greenwood,</p>
<p>your friend wants you,' and I knew it was Doreen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I swung to my feet and balanced dizzily for a minute in the middle of</p>
<p>the dark room.  I felt angry with Doreen for waking me up.  All I stood</p>
<p>a chance of getting out of that sad night was a good sleep, and she had</p>
<p>to wake me up and spoil it.  I thought if I pretended to be asleep the</p>
<p>knocking might go away and leave me in peace, but I waited, and it</p>
<p>didn't.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Elly, Elly, Elly,' the first voice mumbled, while the other voice went</p>
<p>on hissing 'Miss Greenwood, Miss Greenwood, Miss Greenwood', as if I</p>
<p>had a split personality or something.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I opened the door and blinked out into the bright hall.  I had the</p>
<p>impression it wasn't night and it wasn't day, but some lurid third</p>
<p>interval that had suddenly slipped between them and would never end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen was slumped against the door-jamb.  When I came out, she toppled</p>
<p>into my arms.  I couldn't see her face because her head was hanging</p>
<p>down on her chest and her stiff blonde hair fell from its dark roots</p>
<p>like a hula fringe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I recognized the short, squat, moustached woman in the black uniform as</p>
<p>the night maid who ironed day-dresses and party-frocks in a crowded</p>
<p>cubicle on our floor.  I couldn't understand how she came to know</p>
<p>Doreen or why she should want to help Doreen wake me up instead of</p>
<p>leading her quietly back to her own room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeing Doreen supported in my arms and silent except for a few wet</p>
<p>hiccups, the woman strode away down the hall to her cubicle with its</p>
<p>ancient Singer sewing-machine and white ironing-board.  I wanted to run</p>
<p>after her and tell her I had nothing to do with Doreen, because she</p>
<p>looked stern and hard-working and moral as an old-style European</p>
<p>immigrant and reminded me of my Austrian grandmother.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Lemme lie down, lemme lie down,' Doreen was muttering.  'Lemme lie</p>
<p>down, lemme lie down.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt if I carried Doreen across the threshold into my room and helped</p>
<p>her on to my bed I would never get rid of her again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her body was warm and soft as a pile of pillows against my arm where</p>
<p>she leaned her weight, and her feet, in their high, spiked heels,</p>
<p>dragged foolishly.  She was much too heavy for me to budge down the</p>
<p>long hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided the only thing to do was to dump her on the carpet and shut</p>
<p>and lock my door and go back to bed.  When Doreen woke up she wouldn't</p>
<p>remember what had happened and would think she must have passed out in</p>
<p>front of my door while I slept, and she would get up of her own accord</p>
<p>and go sensibly back to her room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I started to lower Doreen gently on to the green hall carpet, but she</p>
<p>gave a low moan and pitched forward out of my arms.  A jet of brown</p>
<p>vomit flew from her mouth and spread in a large puddle at my feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly Doreen grew even heavier.  Her head drooped forward into the</p>
<p>puddle, the wisps of her blonde hair dabbling in it like tree roots in</p>
<p>a bog, and I realized she was asleep.  I drew back.  I felt half-asleep</p>
<p>myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I made a decision about Doreen that night.  I decided I would watch her</p>
<p>and listen to what she said, but deep down I would have nothing at all</p>
<p>to do with her.  Deep down, I would be loyal to Betsy and her innocent</p>
<p>friends.  It was Betsy I resembled at heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quietly, I stepped back into my room and shut the door.  On second</p>
<p>thoughts, I didn't lock it.  I couldn't quite bring myself to do that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I woke up in the dull, sunless heat the next morning, I dressed</p>
<p>and splashed my face with cold water and put on some lipstick and</p>
<p>opened the door slowly.  I think I still expected to see Doreen's body</p>
<p>lying there in the pool of vomit like an ugly, concrete testimony to my</p>
<p>own dirty nature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was nobody in the hall.  The carpet stretched from one end of the</p>
<p>hall to the other, clean and eternally verdant except for a faint,</p>
<p>irregular dark stain before my door as if somebody had by accident</p>
<p>spilled a glass of water there, but dabbed it dry again.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Chapter Three</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Arrayed on the _Ladies' Day_ banquet table were yellow-green avocado</p>
<p>pear halves stuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise, and platters of rare</p>
<p>roast beef and cold chicken, and every so often a cut-glass bowl heaped</p>
<p>with black caviar.  I hadn't had time to eat any breakfast at the hotel</p>
<p>cafeteria that morning, except for a cup of over-stewed coffee so</p>
<p>bitter it made my nose curl, and I was starving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before I came to New York I'd never eaten out in a proper restaurant.</p>
<p>I don't count Howard Johnson's, where I only had French fries and</p>
<p>cheeseburgers and vanilla frappes with people like Buddy Willard.  I'm</p>
<p>not sure why it is, but I love food more than just about anything else.</p>
<p>No matter how much I eat, I never put on weight.  With one exception</p>
<p>I've been the same weight for ten years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My favourite dishes are full of butter and cheese and sour cream.  In</p>
<p>New York we had so many free luncheons with people on the magazine and</p>
<p>various visiting celebrities I developed the habit of running my eye</p>
<p>down those huge, handwritten menus, where a tiny side-dish of peas</p>
<p>costs fifty or sixty cents, until I'd picked the richest, most</p>
<p>expensive dishes and ordered a string of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were always taken out on expense accounts, so I never felt guilty.</p>
<p>I made a point of eating so fast I never kept the other people waiting</p>
<p>who generally ordered only chef's salad and grapefruit juice because</p>
<p>they were trying to reduce.  Almost everybody I met in New York was</p>
<p>trying to reduce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I want to welcome the prettiest, smartest bunch of young ladies our</p>
<p>staff has yet had the good luck to meet,' the plump, bald</p>
<p>master-of-ceremonies wheezed into his lapel microphone.  'This banquet</p>
<p>is just a small sample of the hospitality our Food Testing Kitchens</p>
<p>here on _Ladies' Day_ would like to offer in appreciation for your</p>
<p>visit.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>A delicate, ladylike spatter of applause, and we all sat down at the</p>
<p>enormous linen-draped table.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were eleven of us girls from the magazine, together with most of</p>
<p>our supervising editors, and the whole staff of the _Ladies' Day_ Food</p>
<p>Testing Kitchens in hygienic white smocks, neat hair-nets and flawless</p>
<p>make-up of a uniform peach-pie colour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were only eleven of us, because Doreen was missing.  They had set</p>
<p>her place next to mine for some reason, and the chair stayed empty.  I</p>
<p>saved her place-card for her--a pocket mirror with 'Doreen' painted</p>
<p>along the top of it in lacy script and a wreath of frosted daisies</p>
<p>around the edge, framing the silver hole where her face would show.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen was spending the day with Lenny Shepherd.  She spent most of her</p>
<p>free time with Lenny Shepherd now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the hour before our luncheon at _Ladies' Day_--the big women's</p>
<p>magazine that features lush double-page spreads of technicolour meals,</p>
<p>with a different theme and locale each month--we had been shown around</p>
<p>the endless glossy kitchens and seen how difficult it is to photograph</p>
<p>apple pie _√† la mode_ under bright lights because the ice-cream keeps</p>
<p>melting and has to be propped up from behind with toothpicks and</p>
<p>changed every time it starts looking too soppy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sight of all the food stacked in those kitchens made me dizzy.</p>
<p>It's not that we hadn't enough to eat at home, it's just that my</p>
<p>grandmother always cooked economy joints and economy meat-loafs and had</p>
<p>the habit of saying, the minute you lifted the first forkful to your</p>
<p>mouth, 'I hope you enjoy that, it cost forty-one cents a pound,' which</p>
<p>always made me feel I was somehow eating pennies instead of Sunday</p>
<p>roast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we were standing up behind our chairs listening to the welcome</p>
<p>speech, I had bowed my head and secretly eyed the position of the bowls</p>
<p>of caviar.  One bowl was set strategically between me and Doreen's</p>
<p>empty chair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I figured the girl across from me couldn't reach it because of the</p>
<p>mountainous centrepiece of marzipan fruit, and Betsy, on my right,</p>
<p>would be too nice to ask me to share it with her if I just kept it out</p>
<p>of the way at my elbow by my bread-and-butter plate.  Besides, another</p>
<p>bowl of caviar sat a little way to the right of the girl next to Betsy,</p>
<p>and she could eat that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My grandfather and I had a standing joke.  He was the head waiter at a</p>
<p>country club near my home town, and every Sunday my grandmother drove</p>
<p>in to bring him home for his Monday off.  My brother and I alternated</p>
<p>going with her, and my grandfather always served Sunday supper to my</p>
<p>grandmother and whichever of us was along as if we were regular club</p>
<p>guests.  He loved introducing me to special titbits, and by the age of</p>
<p>nine I had developed a passionate taste for cold vichyssoise and caviar</p>
<p>and anchovy paste.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The joke was that at my wedding my grandfather would see I had all the</p>
<p>caviar I could eat.  It was a joke because I never intended to get</p>
<p>married, and even if I did, my grandfather couldn't have afforded</p>
<p>enough caviar unless he robbed the country club kitchen and carried it</p>
<p>off in a suitcase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under cover of the clinking of water goblets and silverware and bone</p>
<p>china, I paved my plate with chicken slices.  Then I covered the</p>
<p>chicken slices with caviar thickly as if I were spreading peanut-butter</p>
<p>on a piece of bread.  Then I picked up the chicken slices in my fingers</p>
<p>one by one, rolled them so the caviar wouldn't ooze off and ate them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons</p>
<p>to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain</p>
<p>arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly,</p>
<p>you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad-mannered or</p>
<p>poorly brought up.  They will think you are original and very witty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I learned this trick the day Jay Cee took me to lunch with a famous</p>
<p>poet.  He wore a horrible, lumpy, speckled brown tweed jacket and grey</p>
<p>pants and a red-and-blue checked open-throated jersey in a very formal</p>
<p>restaurant full of fountains and chandeliers, where all the other men</p>
<p>were dressed in dark suits and immaculate white shirts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This poet ate his salad with his fingers, leaf by leaf, while talking</p>
<p>to me about the antithesis of nature and art.  I couldn't take my eyes</p>
<p>off the pale, stubby white fingers travelling back and forth from the</p>
<p>poet's salad bowl to the poet's mouth with one dripping lettuce leaf</p>
<p>after another.  Nobody giggled or whispered rude remarks.  The poet</p>
<p>made eating salad with your fingers seem to be the only natural and</p>
<p>sensible thing to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>None of our magazine editors or the _Ladies' Day_ staff members sat</p>
<p>anywhere near me, and Betsy seemed sweet and friendly, she didn't even</p>
<p>seem to like caviar, so I grew more and more confident.  When I</p>
<p>finished my first plate of cold chicken and caviar, I laid out another.</p>
<p>Then I tackled the avocado and crabmeat salad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Avocados are my favourite fruit.  Every Sunday my grandfather used to</p>
<p>bring me an avocado pear hidden at the bottom of his briefcase under</p>
<p>six soiled shirts and the Sunday comics.  He taught me how to eat</p>
<p>avocados by melting grape jelly and French dressing together in a</p>
<p>saucepan and filling the cup of the pear with the garnet sauce.  I felt</p>
<p>homesick for that sauce.  The crabmeat tasted bland in comparison.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How was the fur show?' I asked Betsy, when I was no longer worried</p>
<p>about competition over my caviar.  I scraped the last few salty black</p>
<p>eggs from the dish with my soup spoon and licked it clean.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It was wonderful,' Betsy smiled.  'They showed us how to make an</p>
<p>all-purpose neckerchief out of mink tails and a gold chain, the sort of</p>
<p>chain you can get an exact copy of at Woolworth's for a dollar</p>
<p>ninety-eight, and Hilda nipped down to the wholesale fur warehouses</p>
<p>right afterwards and bought a bunch of mink tails at a big discount and</p>
<p>dropped in at Woolworth's and then stitched the whole thing together</p>
<p>coming up on the bus.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I peered over at Hilda, who sat on the other side of Betsy.  Sure</p>
<p>enough, she was wearing an expensive-looking scarf of furry tails</p>
<p>fastened on one side by a dangling gilt chain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I never really understood Hilda.  She was six feet tall, with huge,</p>
<p>slanted, green eyes and thick red lips and a vacant, Slavic expression.</p>
<p>She made hats.  She was apprenticed to the Fashion Editor, which set</p>
<p>her apart from the more literary ones among us like Doreen and Betsy</p>
<p>and I myself, who all wrote columns, even if some of them were only</p>
<p>about health and beauty.  I don't know if Hilda could read, but she</p>
<p>made startling hats.  She went to a special school for making hats in</p>
<p>New York and every day she wore a new hat to work, constructed by her</p>
<p>own hands out of bits of straw or fur or ribbon or veiling in subtle,</p>
<p>bizarre shades.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's amazing,' I said.  'Amazing.'  I missed Doreen.  She would have</p>
<p>murmured some fine, scalding remark about Hilda's miraculous furpiece</p>
<p>to cheer me up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt very low.  I had been unmasked only that morning by Jay Cee</p>
<p>herself, and I felt now that all the uncomfortable suspicions I had</p>
<p>about myself were coming true, and I couldn't hide the truth much</p>
<p>longer.  After nineteen years of running after good marks and prizes</p>
<p>and grants of one sort and another, I was letting up, slowing down,</p>
<p>dropping clean out of the race.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why didn't you come along to the fur show with us?' Betsy asked.  I</p>
<p>had the impression she was repeating herself, and that she'd asked me</p>
<p>the same question a minute ago, only I couldn't have been listening.</p>
<p>'Did you go off with Doreen?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' I said, 'I wanted to go to the fur show, but Jay Cee called up</p>
<p>and made me come into the office.'  That wasn't quite true about</p>
<p>wanting to go to the show, but I tried to convince myself now that it</p>
<p>was true, so I could be really wounded about what Jay Cee had done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I told Betsy how I had been lying in bed that morning planning to go to</p>
<p>the fur show.  What I didn't tell her was that Doreen had come into my</p>
<p>room earlier and said, 'What do you want to go to that assy show for,</p>
<p>Lenny and I are going to Coney Island, so why don't you come along?</p>
<p>Lenny can get you a nice fellow, the day's shot to hell anyhow with</p>
<p>that luncheon and then the film premi√®re in the afternoon, so nobody'll</p>
<p>miss us.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute I was tempted.  The show certainly did seem stupid.  I</p>
<p>have never cared for furs.  What I decided to do in the end was to lie</p>
<p>in bed as long as I wanted to and then go to Central Park and spend the</p>
<p>day lying in the grass, the longest grass I could find in that bald,</p>
<p>duck-ponded wilderness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I told Doreen I would not go to the show or the luncheon or the film</p>
<p>premi√®re, but that I would not go to Coney Island either, I would stay</p>
<p>in bed.  After Doreen left, I wondered why I couldn't go the whole way</p>
<p>doing what I should any more.  This made me sad and tired.  Then I</p>
<p>wondered why I couldn't go the whole way doing what I shouldn't, the</p>
<p>way Doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't know what time it was, but I'd heard the girls bustling and</p>
<p>calling in the hall and getting ready for the fur show, and then I'd</p>
<p>heard the hall go still, and as I lay on my back in bed staring up at</p>
<p>the blank, white ceiling the stillness seemed to grow bigger and bigger</p>
<p>until I felt my eardrums would burst with it.  Then the phone rang.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared at the phone for a minute.  The receiver shook a bit in its</p>
<p>bone-coloured cradle, so I could tell it was really ringing.  I thought</p>
<p>I might have given my phone number to somebody at a dance or a party</p>
<p>and then forgotten clean, about it.  I lifted the receiver and spoke in</p>
<p>a husky, receptive voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Jay Cee here,' Jay Cee rapped out with brutal promptitude.  'I</p>
<p>wondered if you happened to be planning to come into the office today?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sank down into the sheets.  I couldn't understand why Jay Cee thought</p>
<p>I'd be coming into the office.  We had these mimeographed schedule</p>
<p>cards so we could keep track of all our activities, and we spent a lot</p>
<p>of mornings and afternoons away from the office going to affairs in</p>
<p>town.  Of course, some of the affairs were optional.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was quite a pause.  Then I said meekly, 'I thought I was going to</p>
<p>the fur show.'  Of course I hadn't thought any such thing, but I</p>
<p>couldn't figure out what else to say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I told her I thought I was going to the fur show,' I said to Betsy.</p>
<p>'But she told me to come into the office, she wanted to have a little</p>
<p>talk with me, and there was some work to do.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh-oh!' Betsy said sympathetically.  She must have seen the tears that</p>
<p>plopped down into my dessert dish of meringue and brandy ice-cream,</p>
<p>because she pushed over her own untouched dessert and I started</p>
<p>absently on that when I'd finished my own.  I felt a bit awkward about</p>
<p>the tears, but they were real enough.  Jay Cee had said some terrible</p>
<p>things to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I made my wan entrance into the office at about ten o'clock, Jay</p>
<p>Cee stood up and came round her desk to shut the door, and I sat in the</p>
<p>swivel chair in front of my typewriter table facing her, and she sat in</p>
<p>the swivel chair behind her desk facing me, with the window full of</p>
<p>potted plants, shelf after shelf of them, springing up at her back like</p>
<p>a tropical garden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Doesn't your work interest you, Esther?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, it does, it does,' I said.  'It interests me very much.'  I felt</p>
<p>like yelling the words, as if that might make them more convincing, but</p>
<p>I controlled myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All my life I'd told myself studying and reading and writing and</p>
<p>working like mad was what I wanted to do, and it actually seemed to be</p>
<p>true, I did everything well enough and got all A's, and by the time I</p>
<p>made it to college nobody could stop me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was college correspondent for the town _Gazette_ and editor of the</p>
<p>literary magazine and secretary of Honour Board, which deals with</p>
<p>academic and social offences and punishments--a popular office, and I</p>
<p>had a well-known woman poet and professor on the faculty championing me</p>
<p>for graduate school at the biggest universities in the east, and</p>
<p>promises of full scholarships all the way, and now I was apprenticed to</p>
<p>the best editor on any intellectual fashion magazine, and what did I do</p>
<p>but balk and balk like a dull cart horse?</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm very interested in everything.'  The words fell with a hollow</p>
<p>flatness on to Jay Cee's desk, like so many wooden nickels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm glad of that,' Jay Cee said a bit waspishly.  'You can learn a lot</p>
<p>in this month on the magazine, you know, if you just roll up your</p>
<p>shirt-cuffs.  The girl who was here before you didn't bother with any</p>
<p>of the fashion show stuff.  She went straight from this office, on to</p>
<p>_Time_.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My!' I said, in the same sepulchral tone.  'That was quick!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course, you have another year at college yet,' Jay Cee went on a</p>
<p>little more mildly.  'What do you have in mind after you graduate?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I always thought I had in mind was getting some big scholarship to</p>
<p>graduate school or a grant to study all over Europe, and then I thought</p>
<p>I'd be a professor and write books of poems or write books of poems and</p>
<p>be an editor of some sort.  Usually I had these plans on the tip of my</p>
<p>tongue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't really know,' I heard myself say.  I felt a deep shock,</p>
<p>hearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It sounded true, and I recognized it, the way you recognize some</p>
<p>nondescript person that's been hanging around your door for ages and</p>
<p>then suddenly comes up and introduces himself as your real father and</p>
<p>looks exactly like you, so you know he really is your father, and the</p>
<p>person you thought all your life was your father is a sham.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't really know.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You'll never get anywhere like that.'  Jay Cee paused.  'What</p>
<p>languages do you have?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I can read a bit of French, I guess, and I've always wanted to</p>
<p>learn German.'  I'd been telling people I'd always wanted to learn</p>
<p>German for about five years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother spoke German during her childhood in America and was stoned</p>
<p>for it during the First World War by the children at school.  My</p>
<p>German-speaking father, dead since I was nine, came from some</p>
<p>manic-depressive hamlet in the black heart of Prussia.  My younger</p>
<p>brother was at that moment on the Experiment in International Living in</p>
<p>Berlin and speaking German like a native.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I didn't say was that each time I picked up a German dictionary or</p>
<p>a German book, the very sight of those dense, black, barbed-wire</p>
<p>letters made my mind shut like a clam.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've always thought I'd like to go into publishing.'  I tried to</p>
<p>recover a thread that might lead me back to my old, bright</p>
<p>salesmanship.  'I guess what I'll do is apply at some publishing house.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You ought to read French and German,' Jay Cee said mercilessly, 'and</p>
<p>probably several other languages as well, Spanish and Italian--better</p>
<p>still, Russian.  Hundreds of girls flood into New York every June</p>
<p>thinking they'll be editors.  You need to offer something more than the</p>
<p>run-of-the-mill person.  You better learn some languages.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't the heart to tell Jay Cee there wasn't one scrap of space on</p>
<p>my senior year schedule to learn languages in.  I was taking one of</p>
<p>those honours programmes that teaches you to think independently, and</p>
<p>except for a course in Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and a seminar in advanced</p>
<p>poetry-composition, I would spend my whole time writing on some obscure</p>
<p>theme in the works of James Joyce.  I hadn't picked out my theme yet,</p>
<p>because I hadn't got round to reading _Finnegan's Wake_, but my</p>
<p>professor was very excited about my thesis and had promised to give me</p>
<p>some leads on images about twins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll see what I can do,' I told Jay Cee.  'I probably might just fit</p>
<p>in one of those double-barrelled, accelerated courses in elementary</p>
<p>German they've rigged up.'  I thought at the time I might actually do</p>
<p>this.  I had a way of persuading my Class Dean to let me do irregular</p>
<p>things.  She regarded me as a sort of interesting experiment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At college I had to take a required course in physics and chemistry.  I</p>
<p>had already taken a course in botany and done very well.  I never</p>
<p>answered one test question wrong the whole year, and for a while I</p>
<p>toyed with the idea of being a botanist and studying the wild grasses</p>
<p>in Africa or the South American rain forests, because you can win big</p>
<p>grants to study off-beat things like that in queer areas much more</p>
<p>easily than winning grants to study art in Italy or English in England,</p>
<p>there's not so much competition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Botany was fine, because I loved cutting up leaves and putting them</p>
<p>under the microscope and drawing diagrams of bread mould and the odd,</p>
<p>heart-shaped leaf in the sex cycle of the fern, it seemed so real to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The day I went into physics class it was death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A short dark man with a high, lisping voice, named Mr Manzi, stood in</p>
<p>front of the class in a tight blue suit holding a little wooden ball.</p>
<p>He put the ball on a steep grooved slide and let it run down to the</p>
<p>bottom.  Then he started talking about let _a_ equal acceleration and</p>
<p>let _t_ equal time and suddenly he was scribbling letters and numbers</p>
<p>and equals signs all over the blackboard and my mind went dead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I took the physics book back to my dormitory.  It was a huge book on</p>
<p>porous mimeographed paper--four hundred pages long with no drawings or</p>
<p>photographs, only diagrams and formulas--between brick-red cardboard</p>
<p>covers.  This book was written by Mr Manzi to explain physics to</p>
<p>college girls, and if it worked on us he would try to have it published.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, I studied those formulas, I went to class and watched balls roll</p>
<p>down slides and listened to bells ring and by the end of the semester</p>
<p>most of the other girls had failed and I had a straight A.  I heard Mr</p>
<p>Manzi saying to a bunch of the girls who were complaining that the</p>
<p>course was too hard, 'No, it can't be too hard, because one girl got a</p>
<p>straight A.'  'Who is it?  Tell us,' they said, but he shook his head</p>
<p>and didn't say anything and gave me a sweet little conspiring smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That's what gave me the idea of escaping the next semester of</p>
<p>chemistry.  I may have made a straight A in physics, but I was</p>
<p>panic-struck.  Physics made me sick the whole time I learned it.  What</p>
<p>I couldn't stand was this shrinking everything into letters and</p>
<p>numbers.  Instead of leaf shapes and enlarged diagrams of the holes the</p>
<p>leaves breathe through and fascinating words like carotene and</p>
<p>xanthophyll on the blackboard, there were these hideous, cramped,</p>
<p>scorpion-lettered formulas in Mr Manzi's special red chalk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew chemistry would be worse, because I'd seen a big chart of the</p>
<p>ninety-odd elements hung up in the chemistry lab, and all the perfectly</p>
<p>good words like gold and silver and cobalt and aluminium were shortened</p>
<p>to ugly abbreviations with different decimal numbers after them.  If I</p>
<p>had to strain my brain with any more of that stuff I would go mad.  I</p>
<p>would fail outright.  It was only by a horrible effort of will that I</p>
<p>had dragged myself through the first half of the year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I went to my Class Dean with a clever plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My plan was that I needed the time to take a course in Shakespeare,</p>
<p>since I was, after all, an English major.  She knew and I knew</p>
<p>perfectly well I would get a straight A again in the chemistry course,</p>
<p>so what was the point of my taking the exams, why couldn't I just go to</p>
<p>the classes and look on and take it all in and forget about marks or</p>
<p>credits?  It was a case of honour among honourable people, and the</p>
<p>content meant more than the form, and marks were really a bit silly</p>
<p>anyway, weren't they, when you knew you'd always get an A?  My plan was</p>
<p>strengthened by the fact that the college had just dropped the second</p>
<p>year of required science for the classes after me anyway, so my class</p>
<p>was the last to suffer under the old ruling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Manzi was in perfect agreement with my plan.  I think it flattered</p>
<p>him that I enjoyed his classes so much I would take them for no</p>
<p>materialistic reason like credit and an A, but for the sheer beauty of</p>
<p>chemistry itself.  I thought it was quite ingenious of me to suggest</p>
<p>sitting in on the chemistry course even after I'd changed over to</p>
<p>Shakespeare.  It was quite an unnecessary gesture and made it seem I</p>
<p>simply couldn't bear to give chemistry up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, I would never have succeeded with this scheme if I hadn't</p>
<p>made that A in the first place.  And if my Class Dean had known how</p>
<p>scared and depressed I was, and how I seriously contemplated desperate</p>
<p>remedies such as getting a doctor's certificate that I was unfit to</p>
<p>study chemistry, the formulas made me dizzy and so on, I'm sure she</p>
<p>wouldn't have listened to me for a minute, but would have made me take</p>
<p>the course regardless.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As it happened, the Faculty Board passed my petition, and my Class Dean</p>
<p>told me later that several of the professors were touched by it.  They</p>
<p>took it as a real step in intellectual maturity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had to laugh when I thought about the rest of that year.  I went to</p>
<p>the chemistry class five times a week and didn't miss a single one.  Mr</p>
<p>Manzi stood at the bottom of the big, rickety old amphitheatre, making</p>
<p>blue flames and red flares and clouds of yellow stuff by pouring the</p>
<p>contents of one test-tube into another, and I shut his voice out of my</p>
<p>ears by pretending it was only a mosquito in the distance and sat back</p>
<p>enjoying the bright lights and the coloured fires and wrote page after</p>
<p>page of villanelles and sonnets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Manzi would glance at me now and then and see me writing, and send</p>
<p>up a sweet little appreciative smile.  I guess he thought I was writing</p>
<p>down all those formulas not for exam time, like the other girls, but</p>
<p>because his presentation fascinated me so much I couldn't help it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-4">
<h2>Chapter Four</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know just why my successful evasion of chemistry should have</p>
<p>floated into my mind there in Jay Cee's office.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the time she talked to me, I saw Mr Manzi standing on thin air in</p>
<p>back of Jay Cee's head, like something conjured up out of a hat,</p>
<p>holding his little wooden ball and the test-tube that billowed a great</p>
<p>cloud of yellow smoke the day before Easter vacation and smelt of</p>
<p>rotten eggs and made all the girls and Mr Manzi laugh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt sorry for Mr Manzi.  I felt like going down to him on my hands</p>
<p>and knees and apologizing for being such an awful liar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jay Cee handed me a pile of story manuscripts and spoke to me much more</p>
<p>kindly.  I spent the rest of the morning reading the stories and typing</p>
<p>out what I thought of them on the pink Interoffice Memo sheets and</p>
<p>sending them into the office of Betsy's editor to be read by Betsy the</p>
<p>next day.  Jay Cee interrupted me now and then to tell me something</p>
<p>practical or a bit of gossip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jay Cee was going to lunch that noon with two famous writers, a man and</p>
<p>a lady.  The man had just sold six short stories to the _New Yorker_</p>
<p>and six to Jay Cee.  This surprised me, as I didn't know magazines</p>
<p>bought stories in lots of six, and I was staggered by the thought of</p>
<p>the amount of money six stories would probably bring in.  Jay Cee said</p>
<p>she had to be very careful at this lunch, because the lady writer wrote</p>
<p>stories too, but she had never had any in the _New Yorker_ and Jay Cee</p>
<p>had only taken one from her in five years.  Jay Cee had to flatter the</p>
<p>more famous man at the same time as she was careful not to hurt the</p>
<p>less famous lady.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the cherubs in Jay Cee's French wall-clock waved their wings up</p>
<p>and down and put their little gilt trumpets to their lips and pinged</p>
<p>out twelve notes one after the other, Jay Cee told me I'd done enough</p>
<p>work for the day, and to go off to the _Ladies' Day_ tour and banquet</p>
<p>and to the film premi√®re, and she would see me bright and early</p>
<p>tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then she slipped a suit jacket over her lilac blouse, pinned a hat of</p>
<p>imitation lilacs on the top of her head, powdered her nose briefly and</p>
<p>adjusted her thick spectacles.  She looked terrible, but very wise.  As</p>
<p>she left the office, she patted my shoulder with one lilac-gloved hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't let the wicked city get you down.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat quietly in my swivel chair for a few minutes and thought about</p>
<p>Jay Cee.  I tried to imagine what it would be like if I were Ee Gee,</p>
<p>the famous editor, in an office full of potted rubber plants and</p>
<p>African violets my secretary had to water each morning.  I wished I had</p>
<p>a mother like Jay Cee.  Then I'd know what to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My own mother wasn't much help.  My mother had taught shorthand and</p>
<p>typing to support us ever since my father died, and secretly she hated</p>
<p>it and hated him for dying and leaving no money because he didn't trust</p>
<p>life insurance salesmen.  She was always on to me to learn shorthand</p>
<p>after college, so I'd have a practical skill as well as a college</p>
<p>degree.  'Even the apostles were tent-makers,' she'd say.  'They had to</p>
<p>live, just the way we do.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I dabbled my fingers in the bowl of warm water a _Ladies' Day_ waitress</p>
<p>set down in place of my two empty ice-cream dishes.  Then I wiped each</p>
<p>finger carefully with my linen napkin which was still quite clean.</p>
<p>Then I folded the linen napkin and laid it between my lips and brought</p>
<p>my lips down on it precisely.  When I put the napkin back on the table</p>
<p>a fuzzy pink lip-shape bloomed right in the middle of it like a tiny</p>
<p>heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought what a long way I had come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first time I saw a finger-bowl was at the home of my benefactress.</p>
<p>It was the custom at my college, the little freckled lady in the</p>
<p>Scholarships Office told me, to write to the person whose scholarship</p>
<p>you had, if they were still alive, and thank them for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had the scholarship of Philomena Guinea, a wealthy novelist who went</p>
<p>to my college in the early nineteen-hundreds and had her first novel</p>
<p>made into a silent film with Bette Davis as well as a radio serial that</p>
<p>was still running, and it turned out she was alive and lived in a large</p>
<p>mansion not far from my grandfather's country club.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I wrote Philomena Guinea a long letter in coal-black ink on grey</p>
<p>paper with the name of the college embossed on it in red.  I wrote what</p>
<p>the leaves looked like in autumn when I bicycled out into the hills,</p>
<p>and how wonderful it was to live on a campus instead of commuting by</p>
<p>bus to a city college and having to live at home, and how all knowledge</p>
<p>was opening up before me and perhaps one day I would be able to write</p>
<p>great books the way she did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had read one of Mrs Guinea's books in the town library--the college</p>
<p>library didn't stock them for some reason--and it was crammed from</p>
<p>beginning to end with long, suspenseful questions: 'Would Evelyn</p>
<p>discern that Gladys knew Roger in her past? wondered Hector feverishly'</p>
<p>and 'How could Donald marry her when he learned of the child Elsie,</p>
<p>hidden away with Mrs Rollmop on the secluded country farm? Griselda</p>
<p>demanded of her bleak, moonlit pillow.'  These books earned Philomena</p>
<p>Guinea, who later told me she had been very stupid at college, millions</p>
<p>and millions of dollars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Guinea answered my letter and invited me to lunch at her home.</p>
<p>That was where I saw my first finger-bowl.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The water had a few cherry blossoms floating in it, and I thought it</p>
<p>must be some clear sort of Japanese after-dinner soup and ate every bit</p>
<p>of it, including the crisp little blossoms.  Mrs Guinea never said</p>
<p>anything, and it was only much later, when I told a debutante I knew at</p>
<p>college about the dinner, that I learned what I had done.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When we came out of the sunnily-lit interior of the _Ladies' Day_</p>
<p>offices, the streets were grey and fuming with rain.  It wasn't the</p>
<p>nice kind of rain that rinses you clean, but the sort of rain I imagine</p>
<p>they must have in Brazil.  It flew straight down from the sky in drops</p>
<p>the size of coffee saucers and hit the hot sidewalks with a hiss that</p>
<p>sent clouds of steam writhing up from the gleaming, dark concrete.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My secret hope of spending the afternoon alone in Central Park died in</p>
<p>the glass egg-beater of _Ladies' Day's_ revolving doors.  I found</p>
<p>myself spewed out through the warm rain and into the dim, throbbing</p>
<p>cave of a cab, together with Betsy and Hilda and Emily Ann Offenbach, a</p>
<p>prim little girl with a bun of red hair and a husband and three</p>
<p>children in Teaneck, New Jersey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The movie was very poor.  It starred a nice blonde girl who looked like</p>
<p>June Allyson but was really somebody else, and a sexy black-haired girl</p>
<p>who looked like Elizabeth Taylor but was also somebody else, and two</p>
<p>big, broad-shouldered boneheads with names like Rick and Gil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a football romance and it was in technicolour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hate technicolour.  Everybody in a technicolour movie seems to feel</p>
<p>obliged to wear a lurid new costume in each new scene and to stand</p>
<p>around like a clothes-horse with a lot of very green trees or very</p>
<p>yellow wheat or very blue ocean rolling away for miles and miles in</p>
<p>every direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of the action in this picture took place in the football stands,</p>
<p>with the two girls waving and cheering in smart suits with orange</p>
<p>chrysanthemums the size of cabbages on their lapels, or in a ballroom,</p>
<p>where the girls swooped across the floor with their dates, in dresses</p>
<p>like something out of _Gone With the Wind_, and then sneaked off into</p>
<p>the powder-room to say nasty intense things to each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally I could see the nice girl was going to end up with the nice</p>
<p>football hero and the sexy girl was going to end up with nobody,</p>
<p>because the man named Gil had only wanted a mistress and not a wife all</p>
<p>along and was now packing off to Europe on a single ticket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At about this point I began to feel peculiar.  I looked round me at all</p>
<p>the rows of rapt little heads with the same silver glow on them at the</p>
<p>front and the same black shadow on them at the back, and they looked</p>
<p>like nothing more or less than a lot of stupid moon-brains.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt in terrible danger of puking.  I didn't know whether it was the</p>
<p>awful movie giving me a stomach-ache or all that caviar I had eaten.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm going back to the hotel,' I whispered to Betsy through the</p>
<p>half-dark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Betsy was staring at the screen with deadly concentration.  'Don't you</p>
<p>feel good?' she whispered, barely moving her lips.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' I said.  'I feel like hell.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'So do I, I'll come back with you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>We slipped out of our seats and said Excuse me Excuse me Excuse me down</p>
<p>the length of our row, while the people grumbled and hissed and shifted</p>
<p>their rain boots and umbrellas to let us pass, and I stepped on as many</p>
<p>feet as I could because it took my mind off this enormous desire to</p>
<p>puke that was ballooning up in front of me so fast I couldn't see round</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The remains of a tepid rain were still sifting down when we stepped out</p>
<p>into the street.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Betsy looked a fright.  The bloom was gone from her cheeks and her</p>
<p>drained face floated in front of me, green and sweating.  We fell into</p>
<p>one of those yellow checkered cabs that are always waiting at the kerb</p>
<p>when you are trying to decide whether or not you want a taxi, and by</p>
<p>the time we reached the hotel I had puked once and Betsy had puked</p>
<p>twice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The cab driver took the corners with such momentum that we were thrown</p>
<p>together first on one side of the back seat and then on the other.</p>
<p>Each time one of us felt sick, she would lean over quietly as if she</p>
<p>had dropped something and was picking it up off the floor, and the</p>
<p>other one would hum a little and pretend to be looking out the window.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The cab driver seemed to know what we were doing, even so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey,' he protested, driving through a light that had just turned red,</p>
<p>'you can't do that in my cab, you better get out and do it in the</p>
<p>street.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we didn't say anything, and I guess he figured we were almost at</p>
<p>the hotel so he didn't make us get out until we pulled up in front of</p>
<p>the main entrance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We didn't dare wait to add up the fare.  We stuffed a pile of silver</p>
<p>into the cabby's hand and dropped a couple of kleenexes to cover the</p>
<p>mess on the floor, and ran in through the lobby and on to the empty</p>
<p>elevator.  Luckily for us, it was a quiet time of day.  Betsy was sick</p>
<p>again in the elevator and I held her head, and then I was sick and she</p>
<p>held mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Usually after a good puke you feel better right away.  We hugged each</p>
<p>other and then said good-bye and went off to opposite ends of the hall</p>
<p>to lie down in our own rooms.  There is nothing like puking with</p>
<p>somebody to make you into old friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the minute I'd shut the door behind me and undressed and dragged</p>
<p>myself on to the bed, I felt worse than ever.  I felt I just had to go</p>
<p>to the toilet.  I struggled into my white bathrobe with the blue</p>
<p>cornflowers on it and staggered down to the bathroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Betsy was already there.  I could hear her groaning behind the door, so</p>
<p>I hurried on around the corner to the bathroom in the next wing.  I</p>
<p>thought I would die, it was so far.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat on the toilet and leaned my head over the edge of the washbowl</p>
<p>and I thought I was losing my guts and my dinner both.  The sickness</p>
<p>rolled through me in great waves.  After each wave it would fade away</p>
<p>and leave me limp as a wet leaf and shivering all over and then I would</p>
<p>feel it rising up in me again, and the glittering white torture-chamber</p>
<p>tiles under my feet and over my head and on all four sides closed in</p>
<p>and squeezed me to pieces.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know how long I kept at it.  I let the cold water in the bowl</p>
<p>go on running loudly with the stopper out, so anybody who came by would</p>
<p>think I was washing my clothes, and then when I felt reasonably safe I</p>
<p>stretched out on the floor and lay quite still.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It didn't seem to be summer any more.  I could feel the winter shaking</p>
<p>my bones and banging my teeth together, and the big white hotel towel I</p>
<p>had dragged down with me lay under my head numb as a snowdrift.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it very bad manners for anybody to pound on a bathroom door</p>
<p>the way some person was pounding.  They could just go around the corner</p>
<p>and find another bathroom the way I had done and leave me in peace.</p>
<p>But the person kept banging and pleading with me to let them in and I</p>
<p>thought I dimly recognized the voice.  It sounded a bit like Emily Ann</p>
<p>Offenbach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Just a minute,' I said then.  My words bungled out thick as molasses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pulled myself together and slowly rose and flushed the toilet for the</p>
<p>tenth time and slopped the bowl clean and rolled up the towel so the</p>
<p>vomit stains didn't show very clearly and unlocked the door and stepped</p>
<p>out into the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew it would be fatal if I looked at Emily Ann or anybody else so I</p>
<p>fixed my eyes glassily on a window that swam at the end of the hall and</p>
<p>put one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The next thing I had a view of was somebody's shoe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a stout shoe of cracked black leather and quite old, with tiny</p>
<p>air holes in a scalloped pattern over the toe and a dull polish, and it</p>
<p>was pointed at me.  It seemed to be placed on a hard green surface that</p>
<p>was hurting my right cheekbone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I kept very still, waiting for a clue that would give me some notion of</p>
<p>what to do.  A little to the left of the shoe I saw a vague heap of</p>
<p>blue cornflowers on a white ground and this made me want to cry.  It</p>
<p>was the sleeve of my own bathrobe I was looking at, and my left hand</p>
<p>lay pale as a cod at the end of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She's all right now.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The voice came from a cool, rational region far above my head.  For a</p>
<p>minute I didn't think there was anything strange about it, and then I</p>
<p>thought it was strange.  It was a man's voice, and no men were allowed</p>
<p>to be in our hotel at any time of the night or day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How many others are there?' the voice went on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I listened with interest.  The floor seemed wonderfully solid.  It was</p>
<p>comforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Eleven, I think,' a woman's voice answered.  I figured she must belong</p>
<p>to the black shoe.  'I think there's eleven more of 'um, but one's</p>
<p>missin' so there's oney ten.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, you get this one to bed and I'll take care of the rest.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I heard a hollow boomp boomp in my right ear that grew fainter and</p>
<p>fainter.  Then a door opened in the distance, and there were voices and</p>
<p>groans, and the door shut again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two hands slid under my armpits and the woman's voice said, 'Come,</p>
<p>come, lovey, we'll make it yet,' and I felt myself being half lifted,</p>
<p>and slowly the doors began to move by, one by one, until we came to an</p>
<p>open door and went in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sheet on my bed was folded back, and the woman helped me lie down</p>
<p>and covered me up to the chin and rested for a minute in the bedside</p>
<p>armchair, fanning herself with one plump, pink hand.  She wore</p>
<p>gilt-rimmed spectacles and a white nurse's cap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who are you?' I asked in a faint voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm the hotel nurse.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What's the matter with me?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Poisoned,' she said briefly.  'Poisoned, the whole lot of you.  I</p>
<p>never seen anythin' like it.  Sick here, sick there, whatever have you</p>
<p>young ladies been stuffin' yourselves with?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Is everybody else sick too?' I asked with some hope.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The whole of your lot,' she affirmed with relish.  'Sick as dogs and</p>
<p>cryin' for ma.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The room hovered around me with great gentleness, as if the chairs and</p>
<p>the tables and the walls were withholding their weight out of sympathy</p>
<p>for my sudden frailty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The doctor's given you a ninjection,' the nurse said from the doorway.</p>
<p>'You'll sleep now.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the door took her place like a sheet of blank paper, and then a</p>
<p>larger sheet of paper took the place of the door, and I drifted toward</p>
<p>it and smiled myself to sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Somebody was standing by my pillow with a white cup.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Drink this,' they said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shook my head.  The pillow crackled like a wad of straw.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Drink this and you'll feel better.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>A thick white china cup was lowered under my nose.  In the wan light</p>
<p>that might have been evening and might have been dawn I contemplated</p>
<p>the clear amber liquid.  Pads of butter floated on the surface and a</p>
<p>faint chickeny aroma fumed up to my nostrils.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My eyes moved tentatively to the skirt behind the cup.  'Betsy,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Betsy nothing, it's me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I raised my eyes then, and saw Doreen's head silhouetted against the</p>
<p>paling window, her blonde hair lit at the tips from behind like a halo</p>
<p>of gold.  Her face was in shadow, so I couldn't make out her</p>
<p>expression, but I felt a sort of expert tenderness flowing from the</p>
<p>ends of her fingers.  She might have been Betsy or my mother or a</p>
<p>fern-scented nurse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I bent my head and took a sip of the broth.  I thought my mouth must be</p>
<p>made of sand.  I took another sip and then another and another until</p>
<p>the cup was empty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt purged and holy and ready for a new life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen set the cup on the window-sill and lowered herself into the</p>
<p>armchair.  I noticed that she made no move to take out a cigarette, and</p>
<p>as she was a chain-smoker this surprised me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, you almost died,' she said finally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I guess it was all that caviar.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Caviar nothing!  It was the crabmeat.  They did tests on it and it was</p>
<p>chock-full of ptomaine.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a vision of the celestially white kitchens on _Ladies' Day_</p>
<p>stretching into infinity.  I saw avocado pear after avocado pear being</p>
<p>stuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise and photographed under brilliant</p>
<p>lights.  I saw the delicate, pink-mottled claw-meat poking seductively</p>
<p>through its blanket of mayonnaise and the bland yellow pear cup with</p>
<p>its rim of alligator-green cradling the whole mess.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Poison.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who did tests?'  I thought the doctor might have pumped somebody's</p>
<p>stomach and then analyzed what he found in his hotel laboratory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Those dodos on _Ladies' Day_.  As soon as you all started keeling over</p>
<p>like ninepins somebody called into the office and the office called</p>
<p>across to _Ladies' Day_ and they did tests on everything left over from</p>
<p>the big lunch.  Ha!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ha!' I echoed hollowly.  It was good to have Doreen back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They sent presents,' she added.  'They're in a big carton out in the</p>
<p>hall.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How did they get here so fast?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Special express delivery, what do you think?  They can't afford to</p>
<p>have the lot of you running around saying you got poisoned at _Ladies'</p>
<p>Day_.  You could sue them for every penny they own if you just knew</p>
<p>some smart law man.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What are the presents?'  I began to feel if it was a good enough</p>
<p>present I wouldn't mind about what happened, because I felt so pure as</p>
<p>a result.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nobody's opened the box yet, they're all out flat.  I'm supposed to be</p>
<p>carting soup into everybody, seeing as I'm the only one on my feet, but</p>
<p>I brought you yours first.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'See what the present is,' I begged.  Then I remembered and said, 'I've</p>
<p>a present for you as well.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen went out into the hall.  I could hear her rustling around for a</p>
<p>minute and then the sound of paper tearing.  Finally she came back</p>
<p>carrying a thick book with a glossy cover and people's names printed</p>
<p>all over it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'_The Thirty Best Short Stories of the Year._'  She dropped the book in</p>
<p>my lap.  'There's eleven more of them out there in that box.  I suppose</p>
<p>they thought it'd give you something to read while you were sick.'  She</p>
<p>paused.  'Where's mine?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I fished in my pocket-book and handed Doreen the mirror with her name</p>
<p>and the daisies on it.  Doreen looked at me and I looked at her and we</p>
<p>both burst out laughing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You can have my soup if you want,' she said.  'They put twelve soups</p>
<p>on the tray by mistake and Lenny and I stuffed down so many hotdogs</p>
<p>while we were waiting for the rain to stop I couldn't eat another</p>
<p>mouthful.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Bring it in,' I said.  'I'm starving.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-5">
<h2>Chapter Five</h2>
<p></p>
<p>At seven the next morning the telephone rang.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep.  I already had a</p>
<p>telegram from Jay Cee stuck in my mirror, telling me not to bother to</p>
<p>come into work but to rest for a day and get completely well, and how</p>
<p>sorry she was about the bad crabmeat, so I couldn't imagine who would</p>
<p>be calling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I reached out and hitched the receiver on to my pillow so the</p>
<p>mouthpiece rested on my collarbone and the earpiece lay on my shoulder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>A man's voice said, 'Is that Miss Esther Greenwood?'  I thought I</p>
<p>detected a slight foreign accent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It certainly is,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'This is Constantin Something-or-Other.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't make out the last name, but it was full of S's and K's.  I</p>
<p>didn't know any Constantin, but I hadn't the heart to say so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I remembered Mrs Willard and her simultaneous interpreter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course, of course!' I cried, sitting up and clutching the phone to</p>
<p>me with both hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd never have given Mrs Willard credit for introducing me to a man</p>
<p>named Constantin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I collected men with interesting names.  I already knew a Socrates.  He</p>
<p>was tall and ugly and intellectual and the son of some big Greek movie</p>
<p>producer in Hollywood, but also a Catholic, which ruined it for both of</p>
<p>us.  In addition to Socrates I knew a White Russian named Attila at the</p>
<p>Boston School of Business Administration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gradually I realized that Constantin was trying to arrange a meeting</p>
<p>for us later in the day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Would you like to see the UN this afternoon?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can already see the UN,' I told him, with a little hysterical giggle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He seemed nonplussed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can see it from my window.'  I thought perhaps my English was a</p>
<p>touch too fast for him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he said, 'Maybe you would like a bite to eat afterwards.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I detected the vocabulary of Mrs Willard and my heart sank.  Mrs</p>
<p>Willard always invited you for a bite to eat.  I remembered that this</p>
<p>man had been a guest at Mrs Willard's house when he first came to</p>
<p>America--Mrs Willard had one of these arrangements where you open your</p>
<p>house to foreigners and then when you go abroad they open their houses</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I now saw quite clearly that Mrs Willard had simply traded her open</p>
<p>house in Russia for my bite to eat in New York.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes, I would like a bite to eat,' I said stiffly.  'What time will you</p>
<p>come?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll call for you in my car about two.  It's the Amazon, isn't it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ah, I know where that is.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a moment I thought his tone was laden with special meaning, and</p>
<p>then I figured that probably some of the girls at the Amazon were</p>
<p>secretaries at the UN and maybe he had taken one of them out at one</p>
<p>time.  I let him hang up first, and then I hung up and lay back in the</p>
<p>pillows, feeling grim.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There I went again, building up a glamorous picture of a man who would</p>
<p>love me passionately the minute he met me, and all out of a few prosy</p>
<p>nothings.  A duty tour of the UN and a post-UN sandwich!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to jack up my morale.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Probably Mrs Willard's simultaneous interpreter would be short and ugly</p>
<p>and I would come to look down on him in the end the way I looked down</p>
<p>on Buddy Willard.  This thought gave me a certain satisfaction.</p>
<p>Because I did look down on Buddy Willard, and although everybody still</p>
<p>thought I would marry him when he came out of the TB place, I knew I</p>
<p>would never marry him if he were the last man on earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy Willard was a hypocrite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, I didn't know he was a hypocrite at first.  I thought he was</p>
<p>the most wonderful boy I'd ever seen.  I'd adored him from a distance</p>
<p>for five years before he even looked at me, and then there was a</p>
<p>beautiful time when I still adored him and he started looking at me,</p>
<p>and then just as he was looking at me more and more I discovered quite</p>
<p>by accident what an awful hypocrite he was, and now he wanted me to</p>
<p>marry him and I hated his guts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The worst part of it was I couldn't come straight out and tell him what</p>
<p>I thought of him, because he caught TB before I could do that, and now</p>
<p>I had to humour him along till he got well again and could take the</p>
<p>unvarnished truth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided not to go down to the cafeteria for breakfast.  It would only</p>
<p>mean getting dressed, and what was the point of getting dressed if you</p>
<p>were staying in bed for the morning?  I could have called down and</p>
<p>asked for a breakfast tray in my room, I guess, but then I would have</p>
<p>to tip the person who brought it up and I never knew how much to tip.</p>
<p>I'd had some very unsettling experiences trying to tip people in New</p>
<p>York.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I first arrived at the Amazon a dwarfish, bald man in a bellhop's</p>
<p>uniform carried my suitcase up in the elevator and unlocked my room for</p>
<p>me.  Of course I rushed immediately to the window and looked out to see</p>
<p>what the view was.  After a while I was aware of this bellhop turning</p>
<p>on the hot and cold taps in my washbowl and saying 'This is the hot and</p>
<p>this is the cold' and switching on the radio and telling me the names</p>
<p>of all the New York stations and I began to get uneasy, so I kept my</p>
<p>back to him and said firmly, 'Thank you for bringing up my suitcase.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Thank you thank you thank you.  Ha!' he said in a very nasty</p>
<p>insinuating tone, and before I could wheel round to see what had come</p>
<p>over him he was gone, shutting the door behind him with a rude slam.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Later, when I told Doreen about his curious behaviour, she said, 'You</p>
<p>ninny, he wanted his tip.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked how much I should have given and she said a quarter at least</p>
<p>and thirty-five cents if the suitcase was too heavy.  Now I could have</p>
<p>carried that suitcase to my room perfectly well by myself, only the</p>
<p>bellhop seemed so eager to do it that I let him.  I thought that sort</p>
<p>of service came along with what you paid for your hotel room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hate handing over money to people for doing what I could just as</p>
<p>easily do myself, it makes me nervous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen said ten per cent was what you should tip a person, but I</p>
<p>somehow never had the right change and I'd have felt awfully silly</p>
<p>giving somebody half a dollar and saying, 'Fifteen cents of this is a</p>
<p>tip for you, please give me thirty-five cents back.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first time I took a taxi in New York I tipped the driver ten cents.</p>
<p>The fare was a dollar, so I thought ten cents was exactly right and</p>
<p>gave the driver my dime with a little flourish and a smile.  But he</p>
<p>only held it in the palm of his hand and stared and stared at it, and</p>
<p>when I stepped out of the cab, hoping I had not handed him a Canadian</p>
<p>dime by mistake, he started yelling, 'Lady I gotta live like you and</p>
<p>everybody else,' in a loud voice which scared me so much I broke into a</p>
<p>run.  Luckily he was stopped at a traffic light or I think he would</p>
<p>have driven along beside me yelling in that embarrassing way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I asked Doreen about this she said the tipping percentage might</p>
<p>well have risen from ten to fifteen per cent since she was last in New</p>
<p>York.  Either that, or that particular cab-driver was an out and out</p>
<p>louse.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I reached for the book the people from _Ladies' Day_ had sent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I opened it a card fell out.  The front of the card showed a</p>
<p>poodle in a flowered bedjacket sitting in a poodle basket with a sad</p>
<p>face, and the inside of the card showed the poodle lying down in the</p>
<p>basket with a little smile, sound asleep under an embroidered sampler</p>
<p>that said, 'You'll get well best with lots and lots of rest'.  At the</p>
<p>bottom of the card somebody had written, 'Get well quick! from all of</p>
<p>your good friends at _Ladies' Day_' in lavender ink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I flipped through one story after another until finally I came to a</p>
<p>story about a fig-tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This fig-tree grew on a green lawn between the house of a Jewish man</p>
<p>and a convent, and the Jewish man and a beautiful dark nun kept meeting</p>
<p>at the tree to pick the ripe figs, until one day they saw an egg</p>
<p>hatching in a bird's nest on a branch of the tree, and as they watched</p>
<p>the little bird peck its way out of the egg, they touched the backs of</p>
<p>their hands together, and then the nun didn't come out to pick figs</p>
<p>with the Jewish man any more but a mean-faced Catholic kitchen-maid</p>
<p>came to pick them instead and counted up the figs the man picked after</p>
<p>they were both through to be sure he hadn't picked any more than she</p>
<p>had, and the man was furious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it was a lovely story, especially the part about the fig-tree</p>
<p>in winter under the snow and then the fig-tree in spring with all the</p>
<p>green fruit.  I felt sorry when I came to the last page.  I wanted to</p>
<p>crawl in between those black lines of print the way you crawl through a</p>
<p>fence, and go to sleep under that beautiful big green fig-tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It seemed to me Buddy Willard and I were like that Jewish man and that</p>
<p>nun, although of course we weren't Jewish or Catholic but Unitarian.</p>
<p>We had met together under our own imaginary fig-tree, and what we had</p>
<p>seen wasn't a bird coming out of an egg but a baby coming out of a</p>
<p>woman, and then something awful happened and we went our separate ways.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I lay there in my white hotel bed feeling lonely and weak, I thought</p>
<p>of Buddy Willard lying even lonelier and weaker than I was up in that</p>
<p>sanatorium in the Adirondacks, and I felt like a heel of the worst</p>
<p>sort.  In his letters Buddy kept telling me how he was reading poems by</p>
<p>a poet who was also a doctor and how he'd found out about some famous</p>
<p>dead Russian short story writer who had been a doctor too, so maybe</p>
<p>doctors and writers could get along fine after all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now this was a very different tune from what Buddy Willard had been</p>
<p>singing all the two years we were getting to know each other.  I</p>
<p>remember the day he smiled at me and said, 'Do you know what a poem is,</p>
<p>Esther?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, what?' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A piece of dust.'  And he looked so proud of having thought of this</p>
<p>that I just stared at his blond hair and his blue eyes and his white</p>
<p>teeth--he had very long, strong white teeth--and said 'I guess so.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was only in the middle of New York a whole year later that I finally</p>
<p>thought of an answer to that remark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time having imaginary conversations with Buddy</p>
<p>Willard.  He was a couple of years older than I was and very</p>
<p>scientific, so he could always prove things.  When I was with him I had</p>
<p>to work to keep my head above water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These conversations I had in my mind usually repeated the beginnings of</p>
<p>conversations I'd really had with Buddy, only they finished with me</p>
<p>answering him back quite sharply, instead of just sitting around and</p>
<p>saying 'I guess so'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, lying on my back in bed, I imagined Buddy saying, 'Do you know</p>
<p>what a poem is, Esther?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, what?' I would say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A piece of dust.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then just as he was smiling and starting to look proud, I would say,</p>
<p>'So are the cadavers you cut up.  So are the people you think you're</p>
<p>curing.  They're dust as dust as dust.  I reckon a good poem lasts a</p>
<p>whole lot longer than a hundred of those people put together.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And of course Buddy wouldn't have any answer to that, because what I</p>
<p>said was true.  People were made of nothing so much as dust, and I</p>
<p>couldn't see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing</p>
<p>poems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were</p>
<p>unhappy or sick and couldn't sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My trouble was I took everything Buddy Willard told me as the</p>
<p>honest-to-God truth.  I remember the first night he kissed me.  It was</p>
<p>after the Yale Junior Prom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was strange, the way Buddy had invited me to that Prom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He popped into my house out of the blue one Christmas vacation, wearing</p>
<p>a thick white turtleneck sweater and looking so handsome I could hardly</p>
<p>stop staring and said, 'I might drop over to see you at college some</p>
<p>day, all right?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was flabbergasted.  I only saw Buddy at church on Sundays when we</p>
<p>were both home from college, and then at a distance, and I couldn't</p>
<p>figure what had put it into his head to run over and see me--he had run</p>
<p>the two miles between our houses for cross-country practice, he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, our mothers were good friends.  They had gone to school</p>
<p>together and then both married their professors and settled down in the</p>
<p>same town, but Buddy was always off on a scholarship at prep school in</p>
<p>the fall or earning money by fighting blister rust in Montana in the</p>
<p>summer, so our mothers being old school chums really didn't matter a</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After this sudden visit I didn't hear a word from Buddy until one fine</p>
<p>Saturday morning in early March.  I was up in my room at college,</p>
<p>studying about Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless for my history</p>
<p>exam on the crusades the coming Monday when the hall phone rang.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Usually people are supposed to take turns answering the hall phone, but</p>
<p>as I was the only freshman on a floor with all seniors they made me</p>
<p>answer it most of the time.  I waited a minute to see if anybody would</p>
<p>beat me to it.  Then I figured everybody was probably out playing</p>
<p>squash or away on week-ends, so I answered it myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Is that you, Esther?' the girl on watch downstairs said, and when I</p>
<p>said Yes, she said, 'There's a man to see you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was surprised to hear this, because of all the blind dates I'd had</p>
<p>that year not one called me up again for a second date.  I just didn't</p>
<p>have any luck.  I hated coming downstairs sweaty-handed and curious</p>
<p>every Saturday night and having some senior introduce me to her aunt's</p>
<p>best friend's son and finding some pale, mushroomy fellow with</p>
<p>protruding ears or buck teeth or a bad leg.  I didn't think I deserved</p>
<p>it.  After all, I wasn't crippled in any way, I just studied too hard,</p>
<p>I didn't know when to stop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, I combed my hair and put on some more lipstick and took my</p>
<p>history book--so I could say I was on my way to the library if it</p>
<p>turned out to be somebody awful--and went down, and there was Buddy</p>
<p>Willard leaning against the mail table in a khaki zipper jacket and</p>
<p>blue dungarees and frayed grey sneakers and grinning up at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I just came over to say hello,' he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it odd he should come all the way up from Yale even</p>
<p>hitch-hiking, as he did, to save money, just to say hello.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello,' I said.  'Let's go out and sit on the porch.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to go out on the porch because the girl on watch was a nosey</p>
<p>senior and eyeing me curiously.  She obviously thought Buddy had made a</p>
<p>big mistake.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We sat side by side in two wicker rocking-chairs.  The sunlight was</p>
<p>clean and windless and almost hot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't stay more than a few minutes,' Buddy said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, come on, stay for lunch,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I can't do that.  I'm up here for the Sophomore Prom with Joan.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt like a prize idiot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How is Joan?' I asked coldly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan Gilling came from our home town and went to our church and was a</p>
<p>year ahead of me at college.  She was a big wheel--president of her</p>
<p>class and a physics major and the college hockey champion.  She always</p>
<p>made me feel squirmy with her starey pebble-coloured eyes and her</p>
<p>gleaming tombstone teeth and her breathy voice.  She was big as a</p>
<p>horse, too.  I began to think Buddy had pretty poor taste.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh Joan,' he said.  'She asked me up to this dance two months ahead of</p>
<p>time and her mother asked my mother if I would take her, so what could</p>
<p>I do?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, why did you say you'd take her if you didn't want to?' I asked</p>
<p>meanly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I like Joan.  She never cares whether you spend any money on her</p>
<p>or not and she enjoys doing things out-of-doors.  The last time she</p>
<p>came down to Yale for house week-end we went on a bicycle trip to East</p>
<p>Rock and she's the only girl I haven't had to push up hills.  Joan's</p>
<p>all right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I went cold with envy.  I had never been to Yale, and Yale was the</p>
<p>place all the seniors in my house liked to go best on week-ends.  I</p>
<p>decided to expect nothing from Buddy Willard.  If you expect nothing</p>
<p>from somebody you are never disappointed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You better go and find Joan then,' I said in a matter-of-fact voice.</p>
<p>'I've a date coming any minute and he won't like seeing me sitting</p>
<p>around with you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A date?'  Buddy looked surprised.  'Who is it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's two,' I said, 'Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy didn't say anything, so I said, 'Those are their nicknames.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I added, 'They're from Dartmouth.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess Buddy never read much history, because his mouth stiffened.  He</p>
<p>swung up from the wicker rocking-chair and gave it a sharp little</p>
<p>unnecessary push.  Then he dropped a pale blue envelope with a Yale</p>
<p>crest into my lap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Here's a letter I meant to leave for you if you weren't in.  There's a</p>
<p>question in it you can answer by mail.  I don't feel like asking you</p>
<p>about it right now.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>After Buddy had gone I opened the letter.  It was a letter inviting me</p>
<p>to the Yale Junior Prom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was so surprised I let out a couple of yips and ran into the house</p>
<p>shouting, 'I'm going I'm going I'm going.'  After the bright white sun</p>
<p>on the porch it looked pitch-dark in there, and I couldn't make out a</p>
<p>thing.  I found myself hugging the senior on watch.  When she heard I</p>
<p>was going to the Yale Junior Prom she treated me with amazement and</p>
<p>respect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Oddly enough, things changed in the house after that.  The seniors on</p>
<p>my floor started speaking to me and every now and then one of them</p>
<p>would answer the phone quite spontaneously and nobody made any more</p>
<p>nasty loud remarks outside my door about people wasting their golden</p>
<p>college days with their noses stuck in a book.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well all during the Junior Prom Buddy treated me like a friend or a</p>
<p>cousin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We danced about a mile apart the whole time, until during 'Auld Lang</p>
<p>Syne' he suddenly rested his chin on the top of my head as if he were</p>
<p>very tired.  Then in the cold, black, three o'clock wind we walked very</p>
<p>slowly the five miles back to the house where I was sleeping in the</p>
<p>living-room on a couch that was too short because it only cost fifty</p>
<p>cents a night instead of two dollars like most of the other places with</p>
<p>proper beds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had imagined Buddy would fall in love with me that week-end and that</p>
<p>I wouldn't have to worry about what I was doing on any more Saturday</p>
<p>nights the rest of the year.  Just as we approached the house where I</p>
<p>was staying Buddy said, 'Let's go up to the chemistry lab.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was aghast.  'The _chem_istry lab?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'  Buddy reached for my hand.  'There's a beautiful view up there</p>
<p>behind the chemistry lab.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And sure enough, there was a sort of hilly place behind the chemistry</p>
<p>lab from which you could see the lights of a couple of the houses in</p>
<p>New Haven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stood pretending to admire them while Buddy got a good footing on the</p>
<p>rough soil.  While he kissed me I kept my eyes open and tried to</p>
<p>memorize the spacing of the house lights so I would never forget them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally Buddy stepped back.  'Wow!' he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Wow what?' I said, surprised.  It had been a dry, uninspiring little</p>
<p>kiss, and I remember thinking it was too bad both our mouths were so</p>
<p>chapped from walking five miles in that cold wind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Wow, it makes me feel terrific to kiss you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I modestly didn't say anything.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I guess you go out with a lot of boys,' Buddy said then.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, I guess I do.'  I thought I must have gone out with a different</p>
<p>boy for every week in the year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, I have to study a lot.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'So do I,' I put in hastily.  'I have to keep my scholarship after all.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Still, I think I could manage to see you every third week-end.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's nice.'  I was almost fainting and dying to get back to college</p>
<p>and tell everybody.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy kissed me again in front of the house steps, and the next fall,</p>
<p>when his scholarship to Medical School came through, I went there to</p>
<p>see him instead of to Yale and it was there I found out how he had</p>
<p>fooled me all those years and what a hypocrite he was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I found out on the day we saw the baby born.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-6">
<h2>Chapter Six</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I had kept begging Buddy to show me some really interesting hospital</p>
<p>sights, so one Friday I cut all my classes and came down for a long</p>
<p>week-end and he gave me the works.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I started out by dressing in a white coat and sitting on a tall stool</p>
<p>in a room with four cadavers, while Buddy and his friends cut them up.</p>
<p>These cadavers were so unhuman-looking they didn't bother me a bit.</p>
<p>They had stiff, leathery, purple-black skin and they smelt like old</p>
<p>pickle jars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After that, Buddy took me out into a hall where they had some big glass</p>
<p>bottles full of babies that had died before they were born.  The baby</p>
<p>in the first bottle had a large white head bent over a tiny curled-up</p>
<p>body the size of a frog.  The baby in the next bottle was bigger and</p>
<p>the baby next to that one was bigger still and the baby in the last</p>
<p>bottle was the size of a normal baby and he seemed to be looking at me</p>
<p>and smiling a little piggy smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was quite proud of the calm way I stared at all these gruesome</p>
<p>things.  The only time I jumped was when I leaned my elbow on Buddy's</p>
<p>cadaver's stomach to watch him dissect a lung.  After a minute or two I</p>
<p>felt this burning sensation in my elbow and it occurred to me the</p>
<p>cadaver might just be half alive since it was still warm, so I leapt</p>
<p>off my stool with a small exclamation.  Then Buddy explained the</p>
<p>burning was only from the pickling fluid, and I sat back in my old</p>
<p>position.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the hour before lunch Buddy took me to a lecture on sickle cell</p>
<p>anaemia and some other depressing diseases, where they wheeled sick</p>
<p>people out on to the platform and asked them questions and then wheeled</p>
<p>them off and showed coloured slides.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One slide I remember showed a beautiful laughing girl with a black mole</p>
<p>on her cheek.  'Twenty days after that mole appeared the girl was</p>
<p>dead,' the doctor said, and everybody went very quiet for a minute and</p>
<p>then the bell rang, so I never really found out what the mole was or</p>
<p>why the girl died.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the afternoon we went to see a baby born.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First we found a linen closet in the hospital corridor where Buddy took</p>
<p>out a white mask for me to wear and some gauze.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A tall fat medical student, big as Sidney Greenstreet, lounged nearby,</p>
<p>watching Buddy wind the gauze round and round my head until my hair was</p>
<p>completely covered and only my eyes peered out over the white mask.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The medical student gave an unpleasant little snicker.  'At least your</p>
<p>mother loves you,' he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was so busy thinking how very fat he was and how unfortunate it must</p>
<p>be for a man and especially a young man to be fat, because what woman</p>
<p>could stand leaning over that big stomach to kiss him, that I didn't</p>
<p>immediately realize what this student had said to me was an insult.  By</p>
<p>the time I figured he must consider himself quite a fine fellow and had</p>
<p>thought up a cutting remark about how only a mother loves a fat man, he</p>
<p>was gone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy was examining a queer wooden plaque on the wall with a row of</p>
<p>holes in it, starting from a hole about the size of a silver dollar and</p>
<p>ending with one the size of a dinner-plate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Fine, fine,' he said to me.  'There's somebody about to have a baby</p>
<p>this minute.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the door of the delivery room stood a thin, stoop-shouldered medical</p>
<p>student Buddy knew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello, Will,' Buddy said.  'Who's on the job?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I am,' Will said gloomily, and I noticed little drops of sweat beading</p>
<p>his high pale forehead.  'I am, and it's my first.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy told me Will was a third-year man and had to deliver eight babies</p>
<p>before he could graduate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then we noticed a bustle at the far end of the hall and some men in</p>
<p>lime-green coats and skull-caps and a few nurses came moving towards us</p>
<p>in a ragged procession wheeling a trolley with a big white lump on it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You oughtn't to see this,' Will muttered in my ear.  'You'll never</p>
<p>want to have a baby if you do.  They oughtn't to let women watch.</p>
<p>It'll be the end of the human race.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy and I laughed, and then Buddy shook Will's hand and we all went</p>
<p>into the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was so struck by the sight of the table where they were lifting the</p>
<p>woman I didn't say a word.  It looked like some awful torture table,</p>
<p>with these metal stirrups sticking up in mid-air at one end and all</p>
<p>sorts of instruments and wires and tubes I couldn't make out properly</p>
<p>at the other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy and I stood together by the window, a few feet away from the</p>
<p>woman, where we had a perfect view.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman's stomach stuck up so high I couldn't see her face or the</p>
<p>upper part of her body at all.  She seemed to have nothing but an</p>
<p>enormous spider-fat stomach and two little ugly spindly legs propped in</p>
<p>the high stirrups, and all the time the baby was being born she never</p>
<p>stopped making this unhuman whooing noise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Later Buddy told me the woman was on a drug that would make her forget</p>
<p>she'd had any pain and that when she swore and groaned she really</p>
<p>didn't know what she was doing because she was in a kind of twilight</p>
<p>sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent.</p>
<p>Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or</p>
<p>she wouldn't groan like that, and she would go straight home and start</p>
<p>another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain</p>
<p>had been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long,</p>
<p>blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up</p>
<p>and shut her in again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The head doctor, who was supervising Will, kept saying to the woman,</p>
<p>'Push down, Mrs Tomolillo, push down, that's a good girl, push down,'</p>
<p>and finally through the split, shaven place between her legs, lurid</p>
<p>with disinfectant, I saw a dark fuzzy thing appear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The baby's head,' Buddy whispered under cover of the woman's groans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the baby's head stuck for some reason, and the doctor told Will</p>
<p>he'd have to make a cut.  I heard the scissors close on the woman's</p>
<p>skin like cloth and the blood began to run down--a fierce, bright red.</p>
<p>Then all at once the baby seemed to pop out into Will's hands, the</p>
<p>colour of a blue plum and floured with white stuff and streaked with</p>
<p>blood, and Will kept saying, 'I'm going to drop it, I'm going to drop</p>
<p>it, I'm going to drop it,' in a terrified voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, you're not,' the doctor said, and took the baby out of Will's</p>
<p>hands and started massaging it, and the blue colour went away and the</p>
<p>baby started to cry in a lorn, croaky voice and I could see it was a</p>
<p>boy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first thing that baby did was pee in the doctor's face.  I told</p>
<p>Buddy later I didn't see how that was possible, but he said it was</p>
<p>quite possible, though unusual, to see something like that happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As soon as the baby was born the people in the room divided up into two</p>
<p>groups, the nurses tying a metal dog-tag on the baby's wrist and</p>
<p>swabbing its eyes with cotton on the end of a stick and wrapping it up</p>
<p>and putting it in a canvas-sided cot, while the doctor and Will started</p>
<p>sewing up the woman's cut with a needle and a long thread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think somebody said, 'It's a boy, Mrs Tomolillo,' but the woman</p>
<p>didn't answer or raise her head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, how was it?' Buddy asked with a satisfied expression as we</p>
<p>walked across the green quadrangle to his room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Wonderful,' I said.  'I could see something like that every day.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't feel up to asking him if there were any other ways to have</p>
<p>babies.  For some reason the most important thing to me was actually</p>
<p>seeing the baby come out of you yourself and making sure it was yours.</p>
<p>I thought if you had to have all that pain anyway you might just as</p>
<p>well stay awake.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had always imagined myself hitching up on to my elbows on the</p>
<p>delivery table after it was all over--dead white, of course, with no</p>
<p>make-up and from the awful ordeal, but smiling and radiant, with my</p>
<p>hair down to my waist, and reaching out for my first little squirmy</p>
<p>child and saying its name, whatever it was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why was it all covered with flour?' I asked then, to keep the</p>
<p>conversation going, and Buddy told me about the waxy stuff that guarded</p>
<p>the baby's skin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we were back in Buddy's room, which reminded me of nothing so much</p>
<p>as a monk's cell, with its bare walls and bare bed and bare floor and</p>
<p>the desk loaded with Gray's Anatomy and other thick gruesome books,</p>
<p>Buddy lit a candle and uncorked a bottle of Dubonnet.  Then we lay down</p>
<p>side by side on the bed and Buddy sipped his wine while I read aloud</p>
<p>'somewhere I have never travelled' and other poems from a book I'd</p>
<p>brought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy said he figured there must be something in poetry if a girl like</p>
<p>me spent all her days over it, so each time we met I read him some</p>
<p>poetry and explained to him what I found in it.  It was Buddy's idea.</p>
<p>He always arranged our week-ends so we'd never regret wasting our time</p>
<p>in any way.  Buddy's father was a teacher, and I think Buddy could have</p>
<p>been a teacher as well, he was always trying to explain things to me</p>
<p>and introduce me to new knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly, after I finished a poem, he said, 'Esther, have you ever seen</p>
<p>a man?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The way he said it I knew he didn't mean a regular man or a man in</p>
<p>general, I knew he meant a man naked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' I said.  'Only statues.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, don't you think you would like to see me?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't know what to say.  My mother and my grandmother had started</p>
<p>hinting around to me a lot lately about what a fine, clean boy Buddy</p>
<p>Willard was, coming from such a fine, clean family, and how everybody</p>
<p>at church thought he was a model person, so kind to his parents and to</p>
<p>older people, as well as so athletic and so handsome and so intelligent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All I'd heard about, really, was how fine and clean Buddy was and how</p>
<p>he was the kind of person a girl should stay fine and clean for.  So I</p>
<p>didn't really see the harm in anything Buddy would think up to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, all right, I guess so,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared at Buddy while he unzipped his chino pants and took them off</p>
<p>and laid them on a chair and then took off his underpants that were</p>
<p>made of something like nylon fishnet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They're cool,' he explained, 'and my mother says they wash easily.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he just stood there in front of me and I kept on staring at him.</p>
<p>The only thing I could think of was turkey neck and turkey gizzards and</p>
<p>I felt very depressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy seemed hurt I didn't say anything.  'I think you ought to get</p>
<p>used to me like this,' he said.  'Now let me see you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But undressing in front of Buddy suddenly appealed to me about as much</p>
<p>as having my Posture Picture taken at college, where you have to stand</p>
<p>naked in front of a camera, knowing all the time that a picture of you</p>
<p>stark naked, both full view and side view, is going into the college</p>
<p>gym files to be marked A B C or D depending on how straight you are.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, some other time,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'All right.'  Buddy got dressed again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then we kissed and hugged a while and I felt a little better.  I drank</p>
<p>the rest of the Dubonnet and sat cross-legged at the end of Buddy's bed</p>
<p>and asked for a comb.  I began to comb my hair down over my face so</p>
<p>Buddy couldn't see it.  Suddenly I said, 'Have you ever had an affair</p>
<p>with anyone, Buddy?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know what made me say it, the words just popped out of my</p>
<p>mouth.  I never thought for one minute that Buddy Willard would have an</p>
<p>affair with anyone.  I expected him to say, 'No, I have been saving</p>
<p>myself for when I get married to somebody pure and a virgin like you'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Buddy didn't say anything, he just turned pink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, have you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you mean, an affair?' Buddy asked then in a hollow voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You know, have you ever gone to bed with anyone?'  I kept rhythmically</p>
<p>combing the hair down over the side of my face nearest to Buddy, and I</p>
<p>could feel the little electric filaments clinging to my hot cheeks and</p>
<p>I wanted to shout, 'Stop, stop, don't tell me, don't say anything.'</p>
<p>But I didn't, I just kept still.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, yes, I have,' Buddy said finally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I almost fell over.  From the first night Buddy Willard kissed me and</p>
<p>said I must go out with a lot of boys, he made me feel I was much more</p>
<p>sexy and experienced than he was and that everything he did like</p>
<p>hugging and kissing and petting was simply what I made him feel like</p>
<p>doing out of the blue, he couldn't help it and didn't know how it came</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I saw he had only been pretending all this time to be so innocent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Tell me about it.'  I combed my hair slowly over and over, feeling the</p>
<p>teeth of the comb dig into my cheek at every stroke.  'Who was it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy seemed relieved I wasn't angry.  He even seemed relieved to have</p>
<p>somebody to tell about how he was seduced.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, somebody had seduced Buddy, Buddy hadn't started it and it</p>
<p>wasn't really his fault.  It was this waitress at the hotel he worked</p>
<p>at as a busboy the last summer on Cape Cod.  Buddy had noticed her</p>
<p>staring at him queerly and shoving her breasts up against him in the</p>
<p>confusion of the kitchen, so finally one day he asked her what the</p>
<p>trouble was and she looked him straight in the eye and said, 'I want</p>
<p>you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Served up with parsley?'  Buddy had laughed innocently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' she had said.  'Some night.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that's how Buddy had lost his pureness and his virginity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first I thought he must have slept with the waitress only the once,</p>
<p>but when I asked how many times, just to make sure, he said he couldn't</p>
<p>remember but a couple of times a week for the rest of the summer.  I</p>
<p>multiplied three by ten and got thirty, which seemed beyond all reason.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After that something in me just froze up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back at college I started asking a senior here and a senior there what</p>
<p>they would do if a boy they knew suddenly told them he'd slept thirty</p>
<p>times with some slutty waitress one summer, smack in the middle of</p>
<p>knowing them.  But these seniors said most boys were like that and you</p>
<p>couldn't honestly accuse them of anything until you were at least</p>
<p>pinned or engaged to be married.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Actually, it wasn't the idea of Buddy sleeping with somebody that</p>
<p>bothered me.  I mean I'd read about all sorts of people sleeping with</p>
<p>each other, and if it had been any other boy I would merely have asked</p>
<p>him the most interesting details, and maybe gone out and slept with</p>
<p>somebody myself just to even things up, and then thought no more about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I couldn't stand was Buddy's pretending I was so sexy and he was</p>
<p>so pure, when all the time he'd been having an affair with that tarty</p>
<p>waitress and must have felt like laughing in my face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What does your mother think about this waitress?' I asked Buddy that</p>
<p>week-end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy was amazingly close to his mother.  He was always quoting what</p>
<p>she said about the relationship between a man and a woman, and I knew</p>
<p>Mrs Willard was a real fanatic about virginity for men and women both.</p>
<p>When I first went to her house for supper she gave me a queer, shrewd,</p>
<p>searching look, and I knew she was trying to tell whether I was a</p>
<p>virgin or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just as I thought, Buddy was embarrassed.  'Mother asked me about</p>
<p>Gladys,' he admitted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, what did you say?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I said Gladys was free, white and twenty-one.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I knew Buddy would never talk to his mother as rudely as that for</p>
<p>my sake.  He was always saying how his mother said, 'What a man wants</p>
<p>is a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security,' and, 'What a</p>
<p>man is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the</p>
<p>arrow shoots off from,' until it made me tired.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every time I tried to argue, Buddy would say his mother still got</p>
<p>pleasure out of his father and wasn't that wonderful for people their</p>
<p>age, it must mean she really knew what was what.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, I had just decided to ditch Buddy Willard for once and for all,</p>
<p>not because he'd slept with that waitress but because he didn't have</p>
<p>the honest guts to admit it straight off to everybody and face up to it</p>
<p>as part of his character, when the phone in the hall rang and somebody</p>
<p>said in a little knowing singsong, 'It's for you, Esther, it's from</p>
<p>Boston.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could tell right away something must be wrong, because Buddy was the</p>
<p>only person I knew in Boston, and he never called me long distance</p>
<p>because it was so much more expensive than letters.  Once, when he had</p>
<p>a message he wanted me to get almost immediately, he went all round his</p>
<p>entry at medical school asking if anybody was driving up to my college</p>
<p>that week-end, and sure enough, somebody was, so he gave them a note</p>
<p>for me and I got it the same day.  He didn't even have to pay for a</p>
<p>stamp.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was Buddy all right.  He told me that the annual fall chest X-ray</p>
<p>showed he had caught TB and he was going off on a scholarship for</p>
<p>medical students who caught TB to a TB place in the Adirondacks.  Then</p>
<p>he said I hadn't written since that last week-end and he hoped nothing</p>
<p>was the matter between us, and would I please try to write him at least</p>
<p>once a week and come to visit him at this TB place in my Christmas</p>
<p>vacation?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had never heard Buddy so upset.  He was very proud of his perfect</p>
<p>health and was always telling me it was psychosomatic when my sinuses</p>
<p>blocked up and I couldn't breathe.  I thought this an odd attitude for</p>
<p>a doctor to have and perhaps he should study to be a psychiatrist</p>
<p>instead, but of course I never came right out and said so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I told Buddy how sorry I was about the TB and promised to write, but</p>
<p>when I hung up I didn't feel one bit sorry.  I only felt a wonderful</p>
<p>relief.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought the TB might just be a punishment for living the kind of</p>
<p>double life Buddy lived and feeling so superior to people.  And I</p>
<p>thought how convenient it would be now I didn't have to announce to</p>
<p>everybody at college I had broken off with Buddy and start the boring</p>
<p>business of blind dates all over again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I simply told everyone that Buddy had TB and we were practically</p>
<p>engaged, and when I stayed in to study on Saturday nights they were</p>
<p>extremely kind to me because they thought I was so brave, working the</p>
<p>way I did just to hide a broken heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Chapter Seven</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, Constantin was much too short, but in his own way he was</p>
<p>handsome, with light brown hair and dark blue eyes and a lively,</p>
<p>challenging expression.  He could almost have been an American, he was</p>
<p>so tan and had such good teeth, but I could tell straight away that he</p>
<p>wasn't.  He had what no American man I've ever met has had, and that's</p>
<p>intuition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the start Constantin guessed I wasn't any prot√©g√©e of Mrs</p>
<p>Willard's.  I raised an eyebrow here and dropped a dry little laugh</p>
<p>there, and pretty soon we were both openly raking Mrs Willard over the</p>
<p>coals and I thought, 'This Constantin won't mind if I'm too tall and</p>
<p>don't know enough languages and haven't been to Europe, he'll see</p>
<p>through all that stuff to what I really am.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constantin drove me to the UN in his old green convertible with</p>
<p>cracked, comfortable brown leather seats and the top down.  He told me</p>
<p>his tan came from playing tennis, and when we were sitting there side</p>
<p>by side flying down the streets in the open sun he took my hand and</p>
<p>squeezed it, and I felt happier than I had been since I was about nine</p>
<p>and running along the hot white beaches with my father the summer</p>
<p>before he died.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And while Constantin and I sat in one of those hushed plush auditoriums</p>
<p>in the UN, next to a stern muscular Russian girl with no make-up who</p>
<p>was a simultaneous interpreter like Constantin, I thought how strange</p>
<p>it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I</p>
<p>was nine years old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After that--in spite of the Girl Scouts and the piano lessons and the</p>
<p>water-colour lessons and the dancing lessons and the sailing camp, all</p>
<p>of which my mother scrimped to give me, and college, with crewing in</p>
<p>the mist before breakfast and black-bottom pies and the little new</p>
<p>firecrackers of ideas going off every day--I had never been really</p>
<p>happy again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared through the Russian girl in her double-breasted grey suit,</p>
<p>rattling off idiom after idiom in her own unknowable tongue--which</p>
<p>Constantin said was the most difficult part, because the Russians</p>
<p>didn't have the same idioms as our idioms--and I wished with all my</p>
<p>heart I could crawl into her and spend the rest of my life barking out</p>
<p>one idiom after another.  It mightn't make me any happier, but it would</p>
<p>be one more little pebble of efficiency among all the other pebbles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Constantin and the Russian girl interpreter and the whole bunch of</p>
<p>black and white and yellow men arguing down there behind their labelled</p>
<p>microphones seemed to move off at a distance.  I saw their mouths going</p>
<p>up and down without a sound, as if they were sitting on the deck of a</p>
<p>departing ship, stranding me in the middle of a huge silence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I started adding up all the things I couldn't do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I began with cooking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My grandmother and my mother were such good cooks that I left</p>
<p>everything to them.  They were always trying to teach me one dish or</p>
<p>another, but I would just look on and say, 'Yes, yes, I see,' while the</p>
<p>instructions slid through my head like water, and then I'd always spoil</p>
<p>what I did so nobody would ask me to do it again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remember Jody, my best and only girl-friend at college in my freshman</p>
<p>year, making me scrambled eggs at her house one morning.  They tasted</p>
<p>unusual, and when I asked her if she had put in anything extra, she</p>
<p>said cheese and garlic salt.  I asked who told her to do that, and she</p>
<p>said nobody, she just thought it up.  But then, she was practical and a</p>
<p>sociology major.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't know shorthand either.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This meant I couldn't get a good job after college.  My mother kept</p>
<p>telling me nobody wanted a plain English major.  But an English major</p>
<p>who knew shorthand was something else again.  Everybody would want her.</p>
<p>She would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she</p>
<p>would transcribe letter after thrilling letter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way.  I wanted</p>
<p>to dictate my own thrilling letters.  Besides, those little shorthand</p>
<p>symbols in the book my mother showed me seemed just as bad as let _t_</p>
<p>equal time and let _s_ equal the total distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My list grew longer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was a terrible dancer.  I couldn't carry a tune.  I had no sense of</p>
<p>balance, and when we had to walk down a narrow board with our hands out</p>
<p>and a book on our heads in gym class I always fell over.  I couldn't</p>
<p>ride a horse or ski, the two things I wanted to do most, because they</p>
<p>cost too much money.  I couldn't speak German or read Hebrew or write</p>
<p>Chinese.  I didn't even know where most of the odd out-of-the-way</p>
<p>countries the UN men in front of me represented fitted in on the map.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the first time in my life, sitting there in the sound-proof heart</p>
<p>of the UN building between Constantin who could play tennis as well as</p>
<p>simultaneously interpret and the Russian girl who knew so many idioms,</p>
<p>I felt dreadfully inadequate.  The trouble was, I had been inadequate</p>
<p>all along, I simply hadn't thought about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and</p>
<p>that era was coming to an end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt like a racehorse in a world without race-tracks or a champion</p>
<p>college footballer suddenly confronted by Wall Street and a business</p>
<p>suit, his days of glory shrunk to a little gold cup on his mantel with</p>
<p>a date engraved on it like the date on a tombstone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig-tree in the</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future</p>
<p>beckoned and winked.  One fig was a husband and a happy home and</p>
<p>children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a</p>
<p>brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor,</p>
<p>and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another</p>
<p>fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers</p>
<p>with queer names and off-beat professions, and another fig was an</p>
<p>Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many</p>
<p>more figs I couldn't quite make out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig-tree, starving to death,</p>
<p>just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would</p>
<p>choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant</p>
<p>losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs</p>
<p>began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the</p>
<p>ground at my feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constantin's restaurant smelt of herbs and spices and sour cream.  All</p>
<p>the time I had been in New York I had never found such a restaurant.  I</p>
<p>only found those Heavenly Hamburger places, where they serve giant</p>
<p>hamburgers and soup-of-the-day and four kinds of fancy cake at a very</p>
<p>clean counter facing a long glarey mirror.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To reach this restaurant we had to climb down seven dimly-lit steps</p>
<p>into a sort of cellar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Travel posters plastered the smoke-dark walls, like so many picture</p>
<p>windows overlooking Swiss lakes and Japanese mountains and African</p>
<p>velds, and thick, dusty bottle-candles that seemed for centuries to</p>
<p>have wept their coloured waxes red over blue over green in a fine,</p>
<p>three-dimensional lace, cast a circle of light round each table where</p>
<p>the faces floated, flushed and flamelike themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know what I ate, but I felt immensely better after the first</p>
<p>mouthful.  It occurred to me that my vision of the fig-tree and all the</p>
<p>fat figs that withered and fell to earth might well have arisen from</p>
<p>the profound void of an empty stomach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constantin kept refilling our glasses with a sweet Greek wine that</p>
<p>tasted of pine bark, and I found myself telling him how I was going to</p>
<p>learn German and go to Europe and be a war correspondent like Maggie</p>
<p>Higgins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt so fine by the time we came to the yoghourt and strawberry jam</p>
<p>that I decided I would let Constantin seduce me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ever since Buddy Willard had told me about that waitress I had been</p>
<p>thinking I ought to go out and sleep with somebody myself.  Sleeping</p>
<p>with Buddy wouldn't count, though, because he would still be one person</p>
<p>ahead of me, it would have to be with somebody else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only boy I ever actually discussed going to bed with was a bitter,</p>
<p>hawk-nosed Southerner from Yale, who came up to college one week-end</p>
<p>only to find his date had eloped with a taxi-driver the day before.  As</p>
<p>the girl had lived in my house and as I was the only one home that</p>
<p>particular night, it was my job to cheer him up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the local coffee-shop, hunched in one of the secretive, high-backed</p>
<p>booths with hundreds of peoples' names gouged into the wood, we drank</p>
<p>cup after cup of black coffee and talked frankly about sex.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This boy--his name was Eric--said he thought it disgusting the way all</p>
<p>the girls at my college stood around on the porches under the porch</p>
<p>lights and in the bushes in plain view, necking madly before the one</p>
<p>o'clock curfew, so everybody passing by could see them.  A million</p>
<p>years of evolution, Eric said bitterly, and what are we?  Animals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Eric told me how he had slept with his first woman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He went to a Southern prep school that specialized in building</p>
<p>all-round gentlemen, and by the time you graduated it was an unwritten</p>
<p>rule that you had to have known a woman.  Known in the Biblical sense,</p>
<p>Eric said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So one Saturday Eric and a few of his classmates took a bus into the</p>
<p>nearest city and visited a notorious whore house.  Eric's whore hadn't</p>
<p>even taken off her dress.  She was a fat, middle-aged woman with dyed</p>
<p>red hair and suspiciously thick lips and rat-coloured skin and she</p>
<p>wouldn't turn off the light, so he had had her under a fly-spotted</p>
<p>twenty-five watt bulb, and it was nothing like it was cracked up to be.</p>
<p>It was boring as going to the toilet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said maybe if you loved a woman it wouldn't seem so boring, but Eric</p>
<p>said it would be spoiled by thinking this woman too was just an animal</p>
<p>like the rest, so if he loved anybody he would never go to bed with</p>
<p>her.  He'd go to a whore if he had to and keep the woman he loved free</p>
<p>of all that dirty business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It had crossed my mind at the time that Eric might be a good person to</p>
<p>go to bed with, since he had already done it and, unlike the usual run</p>
<p>of boys, didn't seem dirty-minded or silly when he talked about it.</p>
<p>But then Eric wrote me a letter saying he thought he might really be</p>
<p>able to love me, I was so intelligent and cynical and yet had such a</p>
<p>kind face, surprisingly like his older sister's; so I knew it was no</p>
<p>use, I was the type he would never go to bed with, and wrote him I was</p>
<p>unfortunately about to marry a childhood sweetheart.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The more I thought about it the better I liked the idea of being</p>
<p>seduced by a simultaneous interpreter in New York City.  Constantin</p>
<p>seemed mature and considerate in every way.  There were no people I</p>
<p>knew he would want to brag to about it, the way college boys bragged</p>
<p>about sleeping with girls in the backs of cars to their room-mates or</p>
<p>their friends on the basketball team.  And there would be a pleasant</p>
<p>irony in sleeping with a man Mrs Willard had introduced me to, as if</p>
<p>she were, in a roundabout way, to blame for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Constantin asked if I would like to come up to his apartment to</p>
<p>hear some balalaika records I smiled to myself.  My mother had always</p>
<p>told me never under any circumstances to go with a man to a man's rooms</p>
<p>after an evening out, it could mean only the one thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I am very fond of balalaika music,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constantin's room had a balcony, and the balcony overlooked the river,</p>
<p>and we could hear the hooing of the tugs down in the darkness.  I felt</p>
<p>moved and tender and perfectly certain about what I was going to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew I might have a baby, but that thought hung far and dim in the</p>
<p>distance and didn't trouble me at all.  There was no one hundred per</p>
<p>cent sure way not to have a baby, it said in an article my mother cut</p>
<p>out of the _Reader's Digest_ and mailed to me at college.  This article</p>
<p>was written by a married woman lawyer with children and called 'In</p>
<p>Defence of Chastity'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It gave all the reasons a girl shouldn't sleep with anybody but her</p>
<p>husband and then only after they were married.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main point of the article was that a man's world is different from</p>
<p>a woman's world and a man's emotions are different from a woman's</p>
<p>emotions and only marriage can bring the two worlds and the two</p>
<p>different sets of emotions together properly.  My mother said this was</p>
<p>something a girl didn't know about till it was too late, so she had to</p>
<p>take the advice of people who were already experts, like a married</p>
<p>woman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This woman lawyer said the best men wanted to be pure for their wives,</p>
<p>and even if they weren't pure, they wanted to be the ones to teach</p>
<p>their wives about sex.  Of course they would try to persuade a girl to</p>
<p>have sex and say they would marry her later, but as soon as she gave</p>
<p>in, they would lose all respect for her and start saying that if she</p>
<p>did that with them she would do that with other men and they would end</p>
<p>up by making her life miserable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman finished her article by saying better be safe than sorry and</p>
<p>besides, there was no sure way of not getting stuck with a baby and</p>
<p>then you'd really be in a pickle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now the one thing this article didn't seem to me to consider was how a</p>
<p>girl felt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It might be nice to be pure and then to marry a pure man, but what if</p>
<p>he suddenly confessed he wasn't pure after we were married, the way</p>
<p>Buddy Willard had?  I couldn't stand the idea of a woman having to have</p>
<p>a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure</p>
<p>and one not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a red-blooded</p>
<p>intelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I</p>
<p>might as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who</p>
<p>wasn't pure either.  Then when he started to make my life miserable I</p>
<p>could make his miserable as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was nineteen, pureness was the great issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of the world being divided up into Catholics and Protestants or</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats or white men and black men or even men and</p>
<p>women, I saw the world divided into people who had slept with somebody</p>
<p>and people who hadn't, and this seemed the only really significant</p>
<p>difference between one person and another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought a spectacular change would come over me the day I crossed the</p>
<p>boundary line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it would be the way I'd feel if I ever visited Europe.  I'd</p>
<p>come home, and if I looked closely into the mirror I'd be able to make</p>
<p>out a little white Alp at the back of my eye.  Now I thought that if I</p>
<p>looked into the mirror tomorrow I'd see a doll-size Constantin sitting</p>
<p>in my eye and smiling out at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well for about an hour we lounged on Constantin's balcony in two</p>
<p>separate sling-back chairs with the victrola playing and the balalaika</p>
<p>records stacked between us.  A faint milky light diffused from the</p>
<p>street lights or the half-moon or the cars or the stars, I couldn't</p>
<p>tell what, but apart from holding my hand Constantin showed no desire</p>
<p>to seduce me whatsoever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked if he was engaged or had any special girl friend, thinking</p>
<p>maybe that's what was the matter, but he said no, he made a point of</p>
<p>keeping clear of such attachments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At last I felt a powerful drowsiness drifting through my veins from all</p>
<p>the pine-bark wine I had drunk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I think I'll go in and lie down,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I strolled casually into the bedroom and stooped over to nudge off my</p>
<p>shoes.  The clean bed bobbed before me like a safe boat.  I stretched</p>
<p>full-length and shut my eyes.  Then I heard Constantin sigh and come in</p>
<p>from the balcony.  One by one his shoes clonked on to the floor, and he</p>
<p>lay down by my side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at him secretly from under a fall of hair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was lying on his back, his hands under his head, staring at the</p>
<p>ceiling.  The starched white sleeves of his shirt, rolled up to the</p>
<p>elbows, glimmered eerily in the half-dark and his tan skin seemed</p>
<p>almost black.  I thought he must be the most beautiful man I'd ever</p>
<p>seen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought if only I had a keen, shapely bone-structure to my face or</p>
<p>could discuss politics shrewdly or was a famous writer Constantin might</p>
<p>find me interesting enough to sleep with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then I wondered if as soon as he came to like me he would sink into</p>
<p>ordinariness, and if as soon as he came to love me I would find fault</p>
<p>after fault, the way I did with Buddy Willard and the boys before him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same thing happened over and over:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would catch sight of some flawless man off in the distance, but as</p>
<p>soon as he moved closer I immediately saw he wouldn't do at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That's one of the reasons I never wanted to get married.  The last</p>
<p>thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow</p>
<p>shoots off from.  I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in</p>
<p>all directions myself, like the coloured arrows from a Fourth of July</p>
<p>rocket.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I woke to the sound of rain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was pitch dark.  After a while I deciphered the faint outlines of an</p>
<p>unfamiliar window.  Every so often a beam of light appeared out of thin</p>
<p>air, traversed the wall like a ghostly, exploratory finger, and slid</p>
<p>off into nothing again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I heard the sound of somebody breathing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first I thought it was only myself, and that I was lying in the dark</p>
<p>in my hotel room after being poisoned.  I held my breath, but the</p>
<p>breathing kept on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A green eye glowed on the bed beside me.  It was divided into quarters</p>
<p>like a compass.  I reached out slowly and closed my hand on it.  I</p>
<p>lifted it up.  With it came an arm, heavy as a dead man's, but warm</p>
<p>with sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constantin's watch said three o'clock.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was lying in his shirt and trousers and stocking feet just as I had</p>
<p>left him when I dropped asleep, and as my eyes grew used to the</p>
<p>darkness I made out his pale eyelids and his straight nose and his</p>
<p>tolerant, shapely mouth, but they seemed insubstantial, as if drawn on</p>
<p>fog.  For a few minutes I leaned over, studying him.  I had never</p>
<p>fallen asleep beside a man before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to imagine what it would be like if Constantin were my husband.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It would mean getting up at seven and cooking him eggs and bacon and</p>
<p>toast and coffee and dawdling about in my nightgown and curlers after</p>
<p>he'd left for work to wash up the dirty plates and make the bed, and</p>
<p>then when he came home after a lively, fascinating day he'd expect a</p>
<p>big dinner, and I'd spend the evening washing up even more dirty plates</p>
<p>till I fell into bed, utterly exhausted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This seemed a dreary and wasted life for a girl with fifteen years of</p>
<p>straight A's, but I knew that's what marriage was like, because cook</p>
<p>and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard's mother did from</p>
<p>morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and</p>
<p>had been a private school teacher herself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once when I visited Buddy I found Mrs Willard braiding a rug out of</p>
<p>strips of wool from Mr Willard's old suits.  She'd spent weeks on that</p>
<p>rug, and I had admired the tweedy browns and greens and blues</p>
<p>patterning the braid, but after Mrs Willard was through, instead of</p>
<p>hanging the rug on the wall the way I would have done, she put it down</p>
<p>in place of her kitchen mat, and in a few days it was soiled and dull</p>
<p>and indistinguishable from any mat you could buy for under a dollar in</p>
<p>the Five and Ten.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant</p>
<p>dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he</p>
<p>secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten</p>
<p>out underneath his feet like Mrs Willard's kitchen mat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hadn't my own mother told me that as soon as she and my father left</p>
<p>Reno on their honeymoon--my father had been married before, so he</p>
<p>needed a divorce--my father said to her, 'Whew, that's a relief, now we</p>
<p>can stop pretending and be ourselves'?--and from that day on my mother</p>
<p>never had a minute's peace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also remembered Buddy Willard saying in a sinister, knowing way that</p>
<p>after I had children I would feel differently, I wouldn't want to write</p>
<p>poems any more.  So I began to think maybe it was true that when you</p>
<p>were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and</p>
<p>afterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I stared down at Constantin the way you stare down at a bright,</p>
<p>unattainable pebble at the bottom of a deep well, his eyelids lifted</p>
<p>and he looked through me, and his eyes were full of love.  I watched</p>
<p>dumbly as a little shutter of recognition clicked across the blur of</p>
<p>tenderness and the wide pupils went glossy and depthless as patent</p>
<p>leather.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constantin sat up, yawning.  'What time is it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Three,' I said in a flat voice.  'I better go home.  I have to be at</p>
<p>work first thing in the morning.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll drive you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we sat back to back on our separate sides of the bed fumbling with</p>
<p>our shoes in the horrid cheerful white light of the bed lamp, I sensed</p>
<p>Constantin turn round.  'Is your hair always like that?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Like what?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He didn't answer but reached over and put his hand at the root of my</p>
<p>hair and ran his fingers out slowly to the tip ends like a comb.  A</p>
<p>little electric shock flared through me, and I sat quite still.  Ever</p>
<p>since I was small I loved feeling somebody comb my hair.  It made me go</p>
<p>all sleepy and peaceful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ah, I know what it is,' Constantin said.  'You've just washed it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And he bent to lace up his tennis shoes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An hour later I lay in my hotel bed, listening to the rain.  It didn't</p>
<p>even sound like rain, it sounded like a tap running.  The ache in the</p>
<p>middle of my left shin bone came to life, and I abandoned any hope of</p>
<p>sleep before seven, when my radio-alarm clock would rouse me with its</p>
<p>hearty renderings of Sousa.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every time it rained the old leg-break seemed to remember itself, and</p>
<p>what it remembered was a dull hurt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I thought, 'Buddy Willard made me break that leg.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I thought, 'No, I broke it myself.  I broke it on purpose to pay</p>
<p>myself back for being such a heel.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-8">
<h2>Chapter Eight</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Willard drove me up to the Adirondacks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was the day after Christmas and a grey sky bellied over us, fat with</p>
<p>snow.  I felt overstuffed and dull and disappointed, the way I always</p>
<p>do the day after Christmas, as if whatever it was the pine boughs and</p>
<p>the candles and the silver and gilt-ribboned presents and the birch-log</p>
<p>fires and the Christmas turkey and the carols at the piano promised</p>
<p>never came to pass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Christmas I almost wished I was a Catholic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First Mr Willard drove and then I drove.  I don't know what we talked</p>
<p>about, but as the countryside, already deep under old falls of snow,</p>
<p>turned us a bleaker shoulder, and as the fir trees crowded down from</p>
<p>the grey hills to the road edge, so darkly green they looked black, I</p>
<p>grew gloomier and gloomier.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was tempted to tell Mr Willard to go ahead alone, I would hitch-hike</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But one glance at Mr Willard's face--the silver hair in its boyish</p>
<p>crewcut, the clear blue eyes, the pink cheeks, all frosted like a sweet</p>
<p>wedding cake with the innocent, trusting expression--and I knew I</p>
<p>couldn't do it.  I'd have to see the visit through to the end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At midday the greyness paled a bit, and we parked in an icy turn-off</p>
<p>and shared out the tunafish sandwiches and the oatmeal cookies and the</p>
<p>apples and the thermos of black coffee Mrs Willard had packed for our</p>
<p>lunch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Willard eyed me kindly.  Then he cleared his throat and brushed a</p>
<p>few last crumbs from his lap.  I could tell he was going to say</p>
<p>something serious, because he was very shy, and I'd heard him clear his</p>
<p>throat in that same way before giving an important economics lecture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nelly and I have always wanted a daughter.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>For one crazy minute I thought Mr Willard was going to announce that</p>
<p>Mrs Willard was pregnant and expecting a baby girl.  Then he said, 'But</p>
<p>I don't see how any daughter could be nicer than you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Willard must have thought I was crying because I was so glad he</p>
<p>wanted to be a father to me.  'There, there,' he patted my shoulder and</p>
<p>cleared his throat once or twice.  'I think we understand each other.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he opened the car door on his side and strolled round to my side,</p>
<p>his breath shaping tortuous smoke signals in the grey air.  I moved</p>
<p>over to the seat he had left and he started the car and we drove on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm not sure what I expected of Buddy's sanatorium.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think I expected a kind of wooden chalet perched up on top of a small</p>
<p>mountain, with rosy-cheeked young men and women, all very attractive</p>
<p>but with hectic glittering eyes, lying covered with thick blankets on</p>
<p>outdoor balconies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'TB is like living with a bomb in your lung,' Buddy had written to me</p>
<p>at college.  'You just lie around very quietly hoping it won't go off.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I found it hard to imagine Buddy lying quietly.  His whole philosophy</p>
<p>of life was to be up and doing every second.  Even when we went to the</p>
<p>beach in the summer he never lay down to drowse in the sun the way I</p>
<p>did.  He ran back and forth or played ball or did a little series of</p>
<p>rapid push-ups to use the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Willard and I waited in the reception room for the end of the</p>
<p>afternoon rest cure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The colour scheme of the whole sanatorium seemed to be based on liver.</p>
<p>Dark, glowering woodwork, burnt-brown leather chairs, walls that might</p>
<p>once have been white but had succumbed under a spreading malady of</p>
<p>mould or damp.  A mottled brown linoleum sealed off the floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On a low coffee-table, with circular and semi-circular stains bitten</p>
<p>into the dark veneer, lay a few wilted numbers of _Time_ and _Life_.  I</p>
<p>flipped to the middle of the nearest magazine.  The face of Eisenhower</p>
<p>beamed up at me, bald and blank as the face of a foetus in a bottle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while I became aware of a sly, leaking noise.  For a minute I</p>
<p>thought the walls had begun to discharge the moisture that must</p>
<p>saturate them, but then I saw the noise came from a small fountain in</p>
<p>one corner of the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fountain spurted a few inches into the air from a rough length of</p>
<p>pipe, threw up its hands, collapsed and drowned its ragged dribble in a</p>
<p>stone basin of yellowing water.  The basin was paved with the white</p>
<p>hexagonal tiles one finds in public lavatories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A buzzer sounded.  Doors opened and shut in the distance.  Then Buddy</p>
<p>came in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello, Dad.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy hugged his father, and promptly, with a dreadful brightness, came</p>
<p>over to me and held out his hand.  I shook it.  It felt moist and fat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Willard and I sat together on a leather couch.  Buddy perched</p>
<p>opposite us on the edge of a slippery armchair.  He kept smiling, as if</p>
<p>the corners of his mouth were strung up on invisible wire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The last thing I expected was for Buddy to be fat.  All the time I</p>
<p>thought of him at the sanatorium I saw shadows carving themselves under</p>
<p>his cheekbones and his eyes burning out of almost fleshless sockets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But everything concave about Buddy had suddenly turned convex.  A pot</p>
<p>belly swelled under the tight white nylon shirt and his cheeks were</p>
<p>round and ruddy as marzipan fruit.  Even his laugh sounded plump.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy's eyes met mine.  'It's the eating,' he said.  'They stuff us day</p>
<p>after day and then just make us lie around.  But I'm allowed out on</p>
<p>walk-hours now, so don't worry, I'll thin down in a couple of weeks.'</p>
<p>He jumped up, smiling like a glad host.  'Would you like to see my</p>
<p>room?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I followed Buddy, and Mr Willard followed me, through a pair of</p>
<p>swinging doors set with panes of frosted glass down a dim,</p>
<p>liver-coloured corridor smelling of floor wax and lysol and another</p>
<p>vaguer odour, like bruised gardenias.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy threw open a brown door, and we filed into the narrow room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A lumpy bed, shrouded by a thin white spread, pencil-striped with blue,</p>
<p>took up most of the space.  Next to it stood a bed table with a pitcher</p>
<p>and a water glass and the silver twig of a thermometer poking up from a</p>
<p>jar of pink disinfectant.  A second table, covered with books and</p>
<p>papers and off-kilter clay pots--baked and painted, but not</p>
<p>glazed--squeezed itself between the bed foot and the closet door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well,' Mr Willard breathed, 'it looks comfortable enough.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy laughed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What are these?'  I picked up a clay ashtray in the shape of a</p>
<p>lilypad, with the veinings carefully drawn in yellow on a murky green</p>
<p>ground.  Buddy didn't smoke.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's an ashtray,' Buddy said.  'It's for you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I put the tray down.  'I don't smoke.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I know,' Buddy said.  'I thought you might like it, though.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well,' Mr Willard rubbed one papery lip against another.  'I guess</p>
<p>I'll be getting on.  I guess I'll be leaving you two young people...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Fine, Dad.  You be getting on.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was surprised.  I had thought Mr Willard was going to stay the night</p>
<p>before driving me back the next day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Shall I come too?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, no.'  Mr Willard peeled a few bills from his wallet and handed</p>
<p>them to Buddy.  'See that Esther gets a comfortable seat on the train.</p>
<p>She'll stay a day or so, maybe.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy escorted his father to the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt Mr Willard had deserted me.  I thought he must have planned it</p>
<p>all along, but Buddy said No, his father simply couldn't stand the</p>
<p>sight of sickness and especially his own son's sickness, because he</p>
<p>thought all sickness was sickness of the will.  Mr Willard had never</p>
<p>been sick a day in his life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat down on Buddy's bed.  There simply wasn't anywhere else to sit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy rummaged among his papers in a businesslike way.  Then he handed</p>
<p>me a thin, grey magazine.  'Turn to page eleven.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The magazine was printed somewhere in Maine and full of stencilled</p>
<p>poems and descriptive paragraphs separated from each other by</p>
<p>asterisks.  On page eleven I found a poem titled 'Florida Dawn'.  I</p>
<p>skipped down through image after image about water-melon lights and</p>
<p>turtle-green palms and shells fluted like bits of Greek architecture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Not bad.'  I thought it was dreadful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who wrote it?' Buddy asked with an odd, pigeony smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My eye dropped to the name on the lower right-hand corner of the page.</p>
<p>B. S. Willard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't know.'  Then I said, 'Of course I know, Buddy.  You wrote it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy edged over to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I edged back.  I had very little knowledge about TB, but it seemed to</p>
<p>me an extremely sinister disease, the way it went on so invisibly.  I</p>
<p>thought Buddy might well be sitting in his own little murderous aura of</p>
<p>TB germs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't worry,' Buddy laughed.  'I'm not positive.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Positive?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You won't catch anything.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy stopped for a breath, the way you do in the middle of climbing</p>
<p>something very steep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I want to ask you a question.'  He had a disquieting new habit of</p>
<p>boring into my eyes with his look as if actually bent on piercing my</p>
<p>head, the better to analyse what went on inside it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'd thought of asking it by letter.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a fleeting vision of a pale blue envelope with a Yale crest on</p>
<p>the back flap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But then I decided it would be better if I waited until you came up,</p>
<p>so I could ask you in person.'  He paused.  'Well, don't you want to</p>
<p>know what it is?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?' I said in a small, unpromising voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy sat down beside me.  He put his arm around my waist and brushed</p>
<p>the hair from my ear.  I didn't move.  Then I heard him whisper, 'How</p>
<p>would you like to be Mrs Buddy Willard?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had an awful impulse to laugh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought how that question would have bowled me over at any time in my</p>
<p>five-or six-year period of adoring Buddy Willard from a distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy saw me hesitate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I'm in no shape now, I know,' he said quickly.  I'm still on</p>
<p>P.A.S. and I may yet lose a rib or two, but I'll be back at med school</p>
<p>by next fall.  A year from this spring at the latest...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I think I should tell you something, Buddy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I know,' Buddy said stiffly.  'You've met someone.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, it's not that.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What is it, then?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm never going to get married.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You're crazy.'  Buddy brightened.  'You'll change your mind.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.  My mind's made up.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Buddy just went on looking cheerful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Remember,' I said, 'that time you hitch-hiked back to college with me</p>
<p>after Skit Night?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I remember.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Remember how you asked me where would I like to live best, the country</p>
<p>or the city?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And you said...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And I said I wanted to live in the country and in the city both?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy nodded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And you,' I continued with sudden force, 'laughed and said I had the</p>
<p>perfect set-up of a true neurotic and that that question came from some</p>
<p>questionnaire you'd had in psychology class that week?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy's smile dimmed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, you were right.  I _am_ neurotic.  I could never settle down in</p>
<p>either the country _or_ the city.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You could live between them,' Buddy suggested helpfully.  'Then you</p>
<p>could go to the city sometimes and to the country sometimes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, what's so neurotic about that?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy didn't answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well?' I rapped out, thinking, 'You can't coddle these sick people,</p>
<p>it's the worst thing for them, it'll spoil them to bits.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nothing,' Buddy said in a pale, still voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Neurotic, ha!'  I let out a scornful laugh.  'If neurotic is wanting</p>
<p>two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I'm</p>
<p>neurotic as hell.  I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually</p>
<p>exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy put his hand on mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Let me fly with you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I stood at the top of the ski slope on Mount Pisgah, looking down.  I</p>
<p>had no business to be up there.  I had never skied before in my life.</p>
<p>Still, I thought I would enjoy the view while I had the chance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At my left, the rope tow deposited skier after skier on the snowy</p>
<p>summit which, packed by much crossing and re-crossing and slightly</p>
<p>melted in the noon sun, had hardened to the consistency and polish of</p>
<p>glass.  The cold air punished my lungs and sinuses to a visionary</p>
<p>clearness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On every side of me the red and blue and white jacketed skiers tore</p>
<p>away down the blinding slope like fugitive bits of an American flag.</p>
<p>From the foot of the ski run, the imitation log cabin lodge piped its</p>
<p>popular songs into the overhang of silence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>_Gazing down on the Jungfrau</p>
<p>From our chalet for two..._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The lilt and boom threaded by me like an invisible rivulet in a desert</p>
<p>of snow.  One careless, superb gesture, and I would be hurled into</p>
<p>motion down the slope towards the small khaki spot in the sidelines,</p>
<p>among the spectators, which was Buddy Willard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All morning Buddy had been teaching me how to ski.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, Buddy borrowed skis and ski poles from a friend of his in the</p>
<p>village, and ski boots from a doctor's wife whose feet were only one</p>
<p>size larger than my own, and a red ski jacket from a student nurse.</p>
<p>His persistence in the face of mulishness was astounding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I remembered that at medical school Buddy had won a prize for</p>
<p>persuading the most relatives of dead people to have their dead ones</p>
<p>cut up whether they needed it or not, in the interests of science.  I</p>
<p>forget what the prize was, but I could just see Buddy in his white coat</p>
<p>with his stethoscope sticking out of a side pocket like part of his</p>
<p>anatomy, smiling and bowing and talking those numb, dumb relatives into</p>
<p>signing the post-mortem papers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, Buddy borrowed a car from his own doctor, who'd had TB himself</p>
<p>and was very understanding, and we drove off as the buzzer for</p>
<p>walk-hour rasped along the sunless sanatorium corridors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy had never skied before either, but he said that the elementary</p>
<p>principles were quite simple, and as he'd often watched the ski</p>
<p>instructors and their pupils he could teach me all I'd need to know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the first half-hour I obediently herring-boned up a small slope,</p>
<p>pushed off with my poles and coasted straight down.  Buddy seemed</p>
<p>pleased with my progress.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's fine, Esther,' he observed, as I negotiated my slope for the</p>
<p>twentieth time.  'Now let's try you on the rope tow.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stepped in my tracks, flushed and panting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But Buddy, I don't know how to zigzag yet.  All those people coming</p>
<p>down from the top know how to zigzag.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, you need only go half-way.  Then you won't gain very much</p>
<p>momentum.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And Buddy accompanied me to the rope tow and showed me how to let the</p>
<p>rope run through my hands, and then told me to close my fingers round</p>
<p>it and go up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It never occurred to me to say no.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wrapped my fingers around the rough, bruising snake of a rope that</p>
<p>slithered through them, and went up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the rope dragged me, wobbling and balancing, so rapidly I couldn't</p>
<p>hope to dissociate myself from it half-way.  There was a skier in front</p>
<p>of me and a skier behind me, and I'd have been knocked over and stuck</p>
<p>full of skis and poles the minute I let go, and I didn't want to make</p>
<p>trouble, so I hung quietly on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the top, though, I had second thoughts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy singled me out, hesitating there in the red jacket.  His arms</p>
<p>chopped the air like khaki windmills.  Then I saw he was signalling me</p>
<p>to come down a path that had opened in the middle of the weaving</p>
<p>skiers.  But as I poised, uneasy, with a dry throat, the smooth white</p>
<p>path from my feet to his feet grew blurred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A skier crossed it from the left, another crossed it from the right,</p>
<p>and Buddy's arms went on waving feebly as antennae from the other side</p>
<p>of a field swarming with tiny moving animalcules like germs, or bent,</p>
<p>bright exclamation marks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked up from that churning amphitheatre to the view beyond it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The great, grey eye of the sky looked back at me, its mist-shrouded sun</p>
<p>focusing all the white and silent distances that poured from every</p>
<p>point of the compass, hill after pale hill, to stall at my feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The interior voice nagging me not to be a fool--to save my skin and</p>
<p>take off my skis and walk down, camouflaged by the scrub pines</p>
<p>bordering the slope--fled like a disconsolate mosquito.  The thought</p>
<p>that I might kill myself formed in my mind coolly as a tree or a flower.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I measured the distance to Buddy with my eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His arms were folded, now, and he seemed of a piece with the split-rail</p>
<p>fence behind him--numb, brown and inconsequential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edging to the rim of the hilltop, I dug the spikes of my poles into the</p>
<p>snow and pushed myself into a flight I knew I couldn't stop by skill or</p>
<p>any belated access of will.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I aimed straight down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A keen wind that had been hiding itself struck me full in the mouth and</p>
<p>raked the hair back horizontal on my head.  I was descending, but the</p>
<p>white sun rose no higher.  It hung over the suspended waves of the</p>
<p>hills, an insentient pivot without which the world would not exist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A small, answering point in my own body flew towards it.  I felt my</p>
<p>lungs inflate with the inrush of scenery--air, mountains, trees,</p>
<p>people.  I thought, 'This is what it is to be happy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I plummeted down past the zigzaggers, the students, the experts,</p>
<p>through year after year of doubleness and smiles and compromise, into</p>
<p>my own past.</p>
<p></p>
<p>People and trees receded on either hand like the dark sides of a tunnel</p>
<p>as I hurtled on to the still, bright point at the end of it, the pebble</p>
<p>at the bottom of the well, the white sweet baby cradled in its mother's</p>
<p>belly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My teeth crunched a gravelly mouthful.  Ice water seeped down my throat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy's face hung over me, near and huge, like a distracted planet.</p>
<p>Other faces showed themselves up in back of his.  Behind them, black</p>
<p>dots swarmed on a plane of whiteness.  Piece by piece, as at the</p>
<p>strokes of a dull godmother's wand, the old world sprang back into</p>
<p>position.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You were doing fine,' a familiar voice informed my ear, 'until that</p>
<p>man stepped into your path.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>People were unfastening my bindings and collecting my ski poles from</p>
<p>where they poked skyward, askew, in their separate snowbanks.  The</p>
<p>lodge fence propped itself at my back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy bent to pull off my boots and the several pairs of white wool</p>
<p>socks that padded them.  His plump hand shut on my left foot, then</p>
<p>inched up my ankle, closing and probing, as if feeling for a concealed</p>
<p>weapon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A dispassionate white sun shone at the summit of the sky.  I wanted to</p>
<p>hone myself on it till I grew saintly and thin and essential as the</p>
<p>blade of a knife.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm going up,' I said.  'I'm going to do it again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, you're not.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>A queer, satisfied expression came over Buddy's face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, you're not,' he repeated with a final smile.  'Your leg's broken</p>
<p>in two places.  You'll be stuck in a cast for months.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Chapter Nine</h2>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm so glad they're going to die.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hilda arched her cat-limbs in a yawn, buried her head in her arms on</p>
<p>the conference table and went back to sleep.  A wisp of bilious green</p>
<p>straw perched on her brow like a tropical bird.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bile green.  They were promoting it for fall, only Hilda, as usual, was</p>
<p>half a year ahead of time.  Bile green with black, bile green with</p>
<p>white, bile green with nile green, its kissing cousin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fashion blurbs, silver and full of nothing, sent up their fishy bubbles</p>
<p>in my brain.  They surfaced with a hollow pop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>_I'm so glad they're going to die_.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I cursed the luck that had timed my arrival in the hotel cafeteria to</p>
<p>coincide with Hilda's.  After a late night I felt too dull to think up</p>
<p>the excuse that would take me back to my room for the glove, the</p>
<p>handkerchief, the umbrella, the notebook I forgot.  My penalty was the</p>
<p>long, dead walk from the frosted glass doors of the Amazon to the</p>
<p>strawberry-marble slab of our entry on Madison Avenue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hilda moved like a mannequin the whole way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's a lovely hat, did you make it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I half-expected Hilda to turn on me and say, 'You sound sick', but she</p>
<p>only extended and then retracted her swanny neck.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The night before I'd seen a play where the heroine was possessed by a</p>
<p>dybbuk, and when the dybbuk spoke from her mouth its voice sounded so</p>
<p>cavernous and deep you couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman.</p>
<p>Well Hilda's voice sounded just like the voice of that dybbuk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She stared at her reflection in the glossed shop windows as if to make</p>
<p>sure, moment by moment, that she continued to exist.  The silence</p>
<p>between us was so profound I thought part of it must be my fault.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I said, 'Isn't it awful about the Rosenbergs?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Rosenbergs were to be electrocuted late that night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes!' Hilda said, and at last I felt I had touched a human string in</p>
<p>the cat's cradle of her heart.  It was only as the two of us waited for</p>
<p>the others in the tomb-like morning gloom of the conference room that</p>
<p>Hilda amplified that Yes of hers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's awful such people should be alive.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>She yawned then, and her pale orange mouth opened on a large darkness.</p>
<p>Fascinated, I stared at the blind cave behind her face until the two</p>
<p>lips met and moved and the dybbuk spoke out of its hiding place, 'I'm</p>
<p>so glad they're going to die.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Come on, give us a smile.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat on the pink velvet love-seat in Jay Cee's office, holding a paper</p>
<p>rose and facing the magazine photographer.  I was the last of the</p>
<p>twelve to have my picture taken.  I had tried concealing myself in the</p>
<p>powder-room, but it didn't work.  Betsy had spied my feet under the</p>
<p>doors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't want my picture taken because I was going to cry.  I didn't</p>
<p>know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or</p>
<p>looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the</p>
<p>sobs would fly out of my throat and I'd cry for a week.  I could feel</p>
<p>the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is</p>
<p>unsteady and too full.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the last round of photographs before the magazine went to</p>
<p>press and we returned to Tulsa or Biloxi or Teaneck or Coos Bay or</p>
<p>wherever we'd come from, and we were supposed to be photographed with</p>
<p>props to show what we wanted to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Betsy held an ear of corn to show she wanted to be a farmer's wife, and</p>
<p>Hilda held the bald, faceless head of a hatmaker's dummy to show she</p>
<p>wanted to design hats, and Doreen held a gold-embroidered sari to show</p>
<p>she wanted to be a social worker in India (she didn't really, she told</p>
<p>me, she only wanted to get her hands on a sari).</p>
<p></p>
<p>When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn't know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, sure you know,' the photographer said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She wants,' said Jay Cee wittily, 'to be everything.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said I wanted to be a poet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then they scouted about for something for me to hold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jay Cee suggested a book of poems, but the photographer said no, that</p>
<p>was too obvious.  It should be something that showed what inspired the</p>
<p>poems.  Finally Jay Cee unclipped the single, long-stemmed paper rose</p>
<p>from her latest hat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The photographer fiddled with his hot white lights.  'Show us how happy</p>
<p>it makes you to write a poem.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared through the frieze of rubber plant leaves in Jay Cee's window</p>
<p>to the blue sky beyond.  A few stagey cloud puffs were travelling from</p>
<p>right to left.  I fixed my eyes on the largest cloud, as if, when it</p>
<p>passed out of sight, I might have the good luck to pass with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt it was very important to keep the line of my mouth level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Give us a smile.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>At last, obediently, like the mouth of a ventriloquist's dummy, my own</p>
<p>mouth started to quirk up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey,' the photographer protested, with sudden foreboding, 'you look</p>
<p>like you're going to cry.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't stop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I buried my face in the pink velvet fa√ßade of Jay Cee's love-seat and</p>
<p>with immense relief the salt tears and miserable noises that had been</p>
<p>prowling around in me all morning burst out into the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I lifted my head, the photographer had vanished.  Jay Cee had</p>
<p>vanished as well.  I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a</p>
<p>terrible animal.  It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it</p>
<p>seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could</p>
<p>lay its paws on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I fumbled in my pocketbook for the gilt compact with the mascara and</p>
<p>the mascara brush and the eyeshadow and the three lipsticks and the</p>
<p>side mirror.  The face that peered back at me seemed to be peering from</p>
<p>the grating of a prison cell after a prolonged beating.  It looked</p>
<p>bruised and puffy and all the wrong colours.  It was a face that needed</p>
<p>soap and water and Christian tolerance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I started to paint it with small heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jay Cee breezed back after a decent interval with an armful of</p>
<p>manuscripts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'These'll amuse you,' she said.  'Have a good read.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every morning a snowy avalanche of manuscripts swelled the dust-grey</p>
<p>piles in the office of the Fiction Editor.  Secretly, in studies and</p>
<p>attics and schoolrooms all over America, people must be writing.  Say</p>
<p>someone or other finished a manuscript every minute; in five minutes</p>
<p>that would be five manuscripts stacked on the Fiction Editor's desk.</p>
<p>Within the hour there would be sixty, crowding each other on to the</p>
<p>floor.  And in a year...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I smiled, seeing a pristine, imaginary manuscript floating in mid-air,</p>
<p>with Esther Greenwood typed in the upper-right hand corner.  After my</p>
<p>month on the magazine I'd applied for a summer school course with a</p>
<p>famous writer where you sent in the manuscript of a story and he read</p>
<p>it and said whether you were good enough to be admitted into his class.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, it was a very small class, and I had sent in my story a long</p>
<p>time ago and hadn't heard from the writer yet, but I was sure I'd find</p>
<p>the letter of acceptance waiting on the mail table at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided I'd surprise Jay Cee and send in a couple of the stories I</p>
<p>wrote in this class under a pseudonym.  Then one day the Fiction Editor</p>
<p>would come in to Jay Cee personally and plop the stories down on her</p>
<p>desk and say, 'Here's something a cut above the usual,' and Jay Cee</p>
<p>would agree and accept them and ask the author to lunch and it would be</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Honestly,' Doreen said, 'this one'll be different.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Tell me about him,' I said stonily.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He's from Peru.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They're squat,' I said.  'They're ugly as Aztecs.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, no, no, sweetie, I've already met him.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were sitting on my bed in a mess of dirty cotton dresses and</p>
<p>laddered nylons and grey underwear, and for ten minutes Doreen had been</p>
<p>trying to persuade me to go to a country club dance with a friend of</p>
<p>somebody Lenny knew which, she insisted, was a very different thing</p>
<p>from a friend of Lenny's, but as I was catching the eight o'clock train</p>
<p>home the next morning I felt I should make some attempt to pack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also had a dim idea that if I walked the streets of New York by</p>
<p>myself all night something of the city's mystery and magnificence might</p>
<p>rub off on to me at last.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I gave it up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was becoming more and more difficult for me to decide to do anything</p>
<p>in those last days.  And when I eventually did decide to do something,</p>
<p>such as packing a suitcase, I only dragged all my grubby, expensive</p>
<p>clothes out of the bureau and the closet and spread them on the chairs</p>
<p>and the bed and the floor and then sat and stared at them, utterly</p>
<p>perplexed.  They seemed to have a separate, mulish identity of their</p>
<p>own that refused to be washed and folded and stowed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's these clothes,' I told Doreen.  'I just can't face these clothes</p>
<p>when I come back.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's easy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And in her beautiful, one-track way, Doreen started to snatch up slips</p>
<p>and stockings and the elaborate strapless bra, full of steel springs--a</p>
<p>free gift from the Primrose Corset Company, which I'd never had the</p>
<p>courage to wear--and finally, one by one, the sad array of queerly-cut</p>
<p>forty dollar dresses...</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey, leave that one out.  I'm wearing it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen extricated a black scrap from her bundle and dropped it in my</p>
<p>lap.  Then, snowballing the rest of the clothes into one soft,</p>
<p>conglomerate mass, she stuffed them out of sight under the bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen knocked on the green door with the gold knob.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Scuffling and a man's laugh, cut short, sounded from inside.  Then a</p>
<p>tall boy in shirtsleeves and a blond crewcut inched the door open and</p>
<p>peered out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Baby!' he roared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen disappeared in his arms.  I thought it must be the person Lenny</p>
<p>knew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stood quietly in the doorway in my black sheath and my black stole</p>
<p>with the fringe, yellower than ever, but expecting less.  'I am an</p>
<p>observer,' I told myself, as I watched Doreen being handed into the</p>
<p>room by the blond boy to another man, who was also tall, but dark, with</p>
<p>slightly longer hair.  This man was wearing an immaculate white suit, a</p>
<p>pale blue shirt and a yellow satin tie with a bright stickpin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't take my eyes off that stickpin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A great white light seemed to shoot out of it, illumining the room.</p>
<p>Then the light withdrew into itself, leaving a dewdrop on a field of</p>
<p>gold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I put one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's a diamond,' somebody said, and a lot of people burst out</p>
<p>laughing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My nail tapped a glassy facet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Her first diamond.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Give it to her, Marco.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco bowed and deposited the stickpin in my palm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It dazzled and danced with light like a heavenly ice-cube.  I slipped</p>
<p>it quickly into my imitation jet bead evening bag and looked round.</p>
<p>The faces were empty as plates, and nobody seemed to be breathing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Fortunately,' a dry, hard hand encircled my upper arm, 'I am escorting</p>
<p>the lady for the rest of the evening.  Perhaps,' the spark in Marco's</p>
<p>eyes extinguished, and they went black, 'I shall perform some small</p>
<p>service...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somebody laughed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'... worthy of a diamond.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The hand round my arm tightened.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ouch!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco removed his hand.  I looked down at my arm.  A thumb-print</p>
<p>purpled into view.  Marco watched me.  Then he pointed to the underside</p>
<p>of my arm.  'Look there.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked, and saw four, faint matching prints.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You see, I am quite serious.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco's small, flickering smile reminded me of a snake I'd teased in</p>
<p>the Bronx Zoo.  When I tapped my finger on the stout cage glass the</p>
<p>snake had opened its clockwork jaws and seemed to smile.  Then it</p>
<p>struck and struck and struck at the invisible pane till I moved off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had never met a woman-hater before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could tell Marco was a woman-hater, because in spite of all the</p>
<p>models and TV starlets in the room that night he paid attention to</p>
<p>nobody but me.  Not out of kindness or even curiosity, but because I'd</p>
<p>happened to be dealt to him, like a playing card in a pack of identical</p>
<p>cards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A man in the country club band stepped up to the mike and started</p>
<p>shaking those seedpod rattles that mean South American music.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco reached for my hand, but I hung on to my fourth daiquiri and</p>
<p>stayed put.  I'd never had a daiquiri before.  The reason I had a</p>
<p>daiquiri was because Marco ordered it for me, and I felt so grateful he</p>
<p>hadn't asked what sort of drink I wanted that I didn't say a word, I</p>
<p>just drank one daiquiri after another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco looked at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you mean, no?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't dance to that kind of music.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't be stupid.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I want to sit here and finish my drink.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco bent towards me with a tight smile, and in one swoop my drink</p>
<p>took wing and landed in a potted palm.  Then Marco gripped my hand in</p>
<p>such a way I had to choose between following him on to the floor or</p>
<p>having my arm torn off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's a tango.'  Marco manoeuvred me out among the dancers.  'I love</p>
<p>tangos.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't dance.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You don't have to dance.  I'll do the dancing.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco hooked an arm around my waist and jerked me up against his</p>
<p>dazzling white suit.  Then he said, 'Pretend you are drowning.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shut my eyes, and the music broke over me like a rainstorm.  Marco's</p>
<p>leg slid forward against mine and my leg slid back and I seemed to be</p>
<p>riveted to him, limb for limb, moving as he moved, without any will or</p>
<p>knowledge of my own, and after a while I thought, 'It doesn't take two</p>
<p>to dance, it only takes one,' and I let myself blow and bend like a</p>
<p>tree in the wind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What did I tell you?'  Marco's breath scorched my ear.  'You're a</p>
<p>perfectly respectable dancer.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I began to see why woman-haters could make such fools of women.</p>
<p>Woman-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chock-full of power.</p>
<p>They descended, and then they disappeared.  You could never catch one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the South American music there was an interval.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco led me through the French doors into the garden.  Lights and</p>
<p>voices spilled from the ballroom window, but a few yards beyond the</p>
<p>darkness drew up its barricade and sealed them off.  In the</p>
<p>infinitesimal glow of the stars, the trees and flowers were strewing</p>
<p>their cool odours.  There was no moon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The box hedges shut behind us.  A deserted golf course stretched away</p>
<p>towards a few hilly clumps of trees, and I felt the whole desolate</p>
<p>familiarity of the scene--the country club and the dance and the lawn</p>
<p>with its single cricket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't know where I was, but it was somewhere in the wealthy suburbs</p>
<p>of New York.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco produced a slim cigar and a silver lighter in the shape of a</p>
<p>bullet.  He set the cigar between his lips and bent over the small</p>
<p>flare.  His face, with its exaggerated shadows and planes of light,</p>
<p>looked alien and pained, like a refugee's.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I watched him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who are you in love with?' I said then.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute Marco didn't say anything, he simply opened his mouth and</p>
<p>breathed out a blue, vaporous ring.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Perfect!' he laughed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ring widened and blurred, ghost-pale on the dark air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he said, 'I am in love with my cousin.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt no surprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why don't you marry her?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Impossible.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco shrugged.  'She's my first cousin.  She's going to be a nun.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Is she beautiful?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'There's no one to touch her.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Does she know you love her?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I paused.  The obstacle seemed unreal to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'If you love her,' I said, 'you'll love somebody else someday.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco dashed his cigar underfoot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ground soared and struck me with a soft shock.  Mud squirmed</p>
<p>through my fingers.  Marco waited until I half rose.  Then he put both</p>
<p>hands on my shoulders and flung me back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My dress...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Your dress!'  The mud oozed and adjusted itself to my shoulder blades.</p>
<p>'Your dress!'  Marco's face lowered cloudily over mine.  A few drops of</p>
<p>spit struck my lips.  'Your dress is black and the dirt is black as</p>
<p>well.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he threw himself face down as if he would grind his body through</p>
<p>me and into the mud.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's happening,' I thought.  'It's happening.  If I just lie here and</p>
<p>do nothing it will happen.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco set his teeth to the strap at my shoulder and tore my sheath to</p>
<p>the waist.  I saw the glimmer of bare skin, like a pale veil separating</p>
<p>two bloody-minded adversaries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Slut!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The word hissed by my ear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Slut!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The dust cleared, and I had a full view of the battle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I began to writhe and bite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco weighed me to the earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Slut!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I gouged at his leg with the sharp heel of my shoe.  He turned,</p>
<p>fumbling for the hurt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I fisted my fingers together and smashed them at his nose.  It was</p>
<p>like hitting the steel plate of a battleship.  Marco sat up.  I began</p>
<p>to cry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco pulled out a white handkerchief and dabbed his nose.  Blackness,</p>
<p>like ink, spread over the pale cloth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sucked at my salty knuckles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I want Doreen.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco stared off across the golf links.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I want Doreen.  I want to go home.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Sluts, all sluts.'  Marco seemed to be talking to himself.  'Yes or</p>
<p>no, it is all the same.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I poked Marco's shoulder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where's Doreen?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco snorted.  'Go to the parking lot.  Look in the backs of all the</p>
<p>cars.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he spun round.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My diamond.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I got up and retrieved my stole from the darkness.  I started to walk</p>
<p>off.  Marco sprang to his feet and blocked my path.  Then,</p>
<p>deliberately, he wiped his finger under his bloody nose and with two</p>
<p>strokes stained my cheeks.  'I have earned my diamond with this blood.</p>
<p>Give it to me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't know where it is.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I knew perfectly well that the diamond was in my evening bag and</p>
<p>that when Marco knocked me down my evening bag had soared, like a night</p>
<p>bird, into the enveloping darkness.  I began to think I would lead him</p>
<p>away and then return on my own and hunt for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had no idea what a diamond that size would buy, but whatever it was,</p>
<p>I knew it would be a lot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marco took my shoulders in both hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Tell me,' he said, giving each word equal emphasis.  'Tell me, or I'll</p>
<p>break your neck.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly I didn't care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's in my imitation jet bead evening bag,' I said.  'Somewhere in the</p>
<p>muck.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I left Marco on his hands and knees, scrabbling in the darkness for</p>
<p>another, smaller darkness that hid the light of his diamond from his</p>
<p>furious eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doreen was not in the ballroom nor in the parking lot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I kept to the fringe of the shadows so nobody would notice the grass</p>
<p>plastered to my dress and shoes, and with my black stole I covered my</p>
<p>shoulders and bare breasts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Luckily for me, the dance was nearly over, and groups of people were</p>
<p>leaving and coming out to the parked cars.  I asked at one car after</p>
<p>another until finally I found a car that had room and would drop me in</p>
<p>the middle of Manhattan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At that vague hour between dark and dawn, the sunroof of the Amazon was</p>
<p>deserted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quiet as a burglar in my cornflower-sprigged bathrobe, I crept to the</p>
<p>edge of the parapet.  The parapet reached almost to my shoulders, so I</p>
<p>dragged a folding chair from the stack against the wall, opened it, and</p>
<p>climbed on to the precarious seat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A stiff breeze lifted the hair from my head.  At my feet, the city</p>
<p>doused its lights in sleep, its buildings blackened, as if for a</p>
<p>funeral.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was my last night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I grasped the bundle I carried and pulled at a pale tail.  A strapless</p>
<p>elasticized slip which, in the course of wear, had lost its elasticity,</p>
<p>slumped into my hand.  I waved it, like a flag of truce, once, twice...</p>
<p>The breeze caught it, and I let go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A white flake floated out into the night, and began its slow descent.</p>
<p>I wondered on what street or rooftop it would come to rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tugged at the bundle again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The wind made an effort, but failed, and a batlike shadow sank towards</p>
<p>the roof garden of the penthouse opposite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Piece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly,</p>
<p>like a loved one's ashes, the grey scraps were ferried off, to settle</p>
<p>here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New</p>
<p>York.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-10">
<h2>Chapter Ten</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The face in the mirror looked like a sick Indian.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I dropped the compact into my pocket-book and stared out of the train</p>
<p>window.  Like a colossal junkyard, the swamps and back lots of</p>
<p>Connecticut flashed past, one broken-down fragment bearing no relation</p>
<p>to another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What a hotch-potch the world was!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I glanced down at my unfamiliar skirt and blouse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The skirt was a green dirndl with tiny black, white and electric blue</p>
<p>shapes swarming across it, and it stuck out like a lampshade.  Instead</p>
<p>of sleeves, the white eyelet blouse had frills at the shoulder, floppy</p>
<p>as the wings of a new angel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd forgotten to save any day clothes from the ones I let fly over New</p>
<p>York, so Betsy had traded me a blouse and skirt for my bathrobe with</p>
<p>the cornflowers on it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A wan reflection of myself, white wings, brown ponytail and all,</p>
<p>ghosted over the landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Pollyanna Cowgirl,' I said out loud.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A woman in the seat opposite looked up from her magazine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't, at the last moment, felt like washing off the two diagonal</p>
<p>lines of dried blood that marked my cheeks.  They seemed touching, and</p>
<p>rather spectacular, and I thought I would carry them around with me,</p>
<p>like the relic of a dead lover, till they wore off of their own accord.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, if I smiled or moved my face much, the blood would flake</p>
<p>away in no time, so I kept my face immobile, and when I had to speak I</p>
<p>spoke through my teeth, without disturbing my lips.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't really see why people should look at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plenty of people looked queerer than I did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My grey suitcase rode on the rack over my head, empty except for _The</p>
<p>Thirty Best Short Stories of the Year_, a white plastic sunglasses case</p>
<p>and two dozen avocado pears, a parting present from Doreen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The pears were unripe, so they would keep well, and whenever I lifted</p>
<p>my suitcase up or down or simply carried it along, they cannoned from</p>
<p>one end to the other with a special little thunder of their own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Root Wan Twenny Ate!' the conductor bawled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The domesticated wilderness of pine, maple and oak rolled to a halt and</p>
<p>stuck in the frame of the train window like a bad picture.  My suitcase</p>
<p>grumbled and bumped as I negotiated the long aisle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stepped from the air-conditioned compartment on to the station</p>
<p>platform, and the motherly breath of the suburbs enfolded me.  It smelt</p>
<p>of lawn sprinklers and station-wagons and tennis rackets and dogs and</p>
<p>babies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother was waiting by the glove-grey Chevrolet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why lovey, what's happened to your face?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Cut myself,' I said briefly, and crawled into the back seat after my</p>
<p>suitcase.  I didn't want her staring at me the whole way home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The upholstery felt slippery and clean.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother climbed behind the wheel and tossed a few letters into my</p>
<p>lap, then turned her back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The car purred into life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I think I should tell you right away,' she said, and I could see bad</p>
<p>news in the set of her neck, 'you didn't make that writing course.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The air punched out of my stomach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All through June the writing course had stretched before me like a</p>
<p>bright, safe bridge over the dull gulf of the summer.  Now I saw it</p>
<p>totter and dissolve, and a body in a white blouse and green skirt</p>
<p>plummet into the gap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then my mouth shaped itself sourly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had expected it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I slunk down on the middle of my spine, my nose level with the rim of</p>
<p>the window, and watched the houses of outer Boston glide by.  As the</p>
<p>houses grew more familiar, I slunk still lower.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt it was very important not to be recognized.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The grey, padded car roof closed over my head like the roof of a prison</p>
<p>van, and the white, shining, identical clapboard houses with their</p>
<p>interstices of well-groomed green proceeded past, one bar after another</p>
<p>in a large but escape-proof cage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had never spent a summer in the suburbs before.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The soprano screak of carriage wheels punished my ear.  Sun, seeping</p>
<p>through the blinds, filled the bedroom with a sulphurous light.  I</p>
<p>didn't know how long I had slept, but I felt one big twitch of</p>
<p>exhaustion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The twin bed next to mine was empty and unmade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At seven I had heard my mother get up, slip into her clothes and tiptoe</p>
<p>out of the room.  Then the buzz of the orange squeezer sounded from</p>
<p>downstairs, and the smell of coffee and bacon filtered under my door.</p>
<p>Then the sink water ran from the tap and dishes clinked as my mother</p>
<p>dried them and put them back in the cupboard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the front door opened and shut.  Then the car door opened and</p>
<p>shut, and the motor went broom-broom and, edging off with a crunch of</p>
<p>gravel, faded into the distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother was teaching shorthand and typing to a lot of city college</p>
<p>girls and wouldn't be home till the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The carriage wheels screaked past again.  Somebody seemed to be</p>
<p>wheeling a baby back and forth under my window.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I slipped out of bed and on to the rug, and quietly, on my hands and</p>
<p>knees, crawled over to see who it was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ours was a small, white clapboard house set in the middle of a small</p>
<p>green lawn on the corner of two peaceful suburban streets, but in spite</p>
<p>of the little maple trees planted at intervals around our property,</p>
<p>anybody passing along the sidewalk could glance up at the second storey</p>
<p>windows and see just what was going on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was brought home to me by our next-door neighbour, a spiteful</p>
<p>woman named Mrs Ockenden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Ockenden was a retired nurse who had just married her third</p>
<p>husband--the other two died in curious circumstances--and she spent an</p>
<p>inordinate amount of time peering from behind the starched white</p>
<p>curtains of her windows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She had called my mother up twice about me--once to report that I had</p>
<p>been sitting in front of the house for an hour under the streetlight</p>
<p>and kissing somebody in a blue Plymouth, and once to say that I had</p>
<p>better pull the blinds down in my room, because she had seen me</p>
<p>half-naked getting ready for bed one night when she happened to be out</p>
<p>walking her Scotch terrier.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With great care, I raised my eyes to the level of the window-sill.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A woman not five feet tall, with a grotesque, protruding stomach, was</p>
<p>wheeling an old black baby carriage down the street.  Two or three</p>
<p>small children of various sizes, all pale, with smudgy faces and bare</p>
<p>smudgy knees, wobbled along in the shadow of her skirts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A serene, almost religious smile lit up the woman's face.  Her head</p>
<p>tilted happily back, like a sparrow egg perched on a duck egg, she</p>
<p>smiled into the sun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew the woman well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was Dodo Conway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dodo Conway was a Catholic who had gone to Barnard and then married an</p>
<p>architect who had gone to Columbia and was also a Catholic.  They had a</p>
<p>big, rambling house up the street from us, set behind a morbid fa√ßade</p>
<p>of pine trees, and surrounded by scooters, tricycles, doll carriages,</p>
<p>toy fire trucks, baseball bats, badminton nets, croquet wickets,</p>
<p>hamster cages and cocker spaniel puppies--the whole sprawling</p>
<p>paraphernalia of suburban childhood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dodo interested me in spite of myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her house was unlike all the others in our neighbourhood in its size</p>
<p>(it was much bigger) and its colour (the second storey was constructed</p>
<p>of dark brown clapboard and the first of grey stucco, studded with grey</p>
<p>and purple golf-ball-shaped stones), and the pine trees completely</p>
<p>screened it from view, which was considered unsociable in our community</p>
<p>of adjoining lawns and friendly, waist-high hedges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dodo raised her six children--and would no doubt raise her seventh--on</p>
<p>rice crispies, peanut-butter-and-marshmallow sandwiches, vanilla</p>
<p>ice-cream and gallon upon gallon of Hoods milk.  She got a special</p>
<p>discount from the local milkman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everybody loved Dodo, although the swelling size of her family was the</p>
<p>talk of the neighbourhood.  The older people around, like my mother,</p>
<p>had two children, and the younger, more prosperous ones had four, but</p>
<p>nobody but Dodo was on the verge of a seventh.  Even six was considered</p>
<p>excessive, but then, everybody said, of course Dodo was a Catholic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I watched Dodo wheel the youngest Conway up and down.  She seemed to be</p>
<p>doing it for my benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Children made me sick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A floorboard creaked, and I ducked down again, just as Dodo Conway's</p>
<p>face, by instinct, or some gift of supernatural hearing, turned on the</p>
<p>little pivot of its neck.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt her gaze pierce through the white clapboard and the pink,</p>
<p>wallpaper roses and uncover me, crouching there behind the silver</p>
<p>pickets of the radiator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I crawled back into bed and pulled the sheet over my head.  But even</p>
<p>that didn't shut out the light, so I buried my head under the darkness</p>
<p>of the pillow and pretended it was night.  I couldn't see the point of</p>
<p>getting up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had nothing to look forward to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while I heard the telephone ringing in the downstairs hall.  I</p>
<p>stuffed the pillow into my ears and gave myself five minutes.  Then I</p>
<p>lifted my head from its bolt hole.  The ringing had stopped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Almost at once it started up again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cursing whatever friend, relative or stranger had sniffed out my</p>
<p>homecoming, I padded barefoot downstairs.  The black instrument on the</p>
<p>hall table trilled its hysterical note over and over, like a nervous</p>
<p>bird.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I picked up the receiver.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hullo,' I said, in a low, disguised voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hullo Esther, what's the matter, have you got laryngitis?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was my old friend Jody, calling from Cambridge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jody was working at the Co-op that summer and taking a lunchtime course</p>
<p>in sociology.  She and two other girls from my college had rented a big</p>
<p>apartment from four Harvard law students, and I'd been planning to move</p>
<p>in with them when my writing course began.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jody wanted to know when they could expect me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm not coming,' I said.  'I didn't make the course.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a small pause.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He's an ass,' Jody said then.  'He doesn't know a good thing when he</p>
<p>sees it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My sentiments exactly.'  My voice sounded strange and hollow in my</p>
<p>ears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Come anyway.  Take some other course.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The notion of studying German or abnormal psychology flitted through my</p>
<p>head.  After all, I'd saved nearly the whole of my New York salary, so</p>
<p>I could just about afford it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the hollow voice said, 'You better count me out.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well,' Jody began, 'there's this other girl who wanted to come in with</p>
<p>us if anybody dropped out...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Fine.  Ask her.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The minute I hung up I knew I should have said I would come.  One more</p>
<p>morning listening to Dodo Conway's baby carriage would drive me crazy.</p>
<p>And I made a point of never living in the same house with my mother for</p>
<p>more than a week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I reached for the receiver.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My hand advanced a few inches, then retreated and fell limp.  I forced</p>
<p>it towards the receiver again, but again it stopped short, as if it had</p>
<p>collided with a pane of glass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wandered into the dining-room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Propped on the table I found a long, business-like letter from the</p>
<p>summer school and a thin blue letter on left-over Yale stationery,</p>
<p>addressed to me in Buddy Willard's lucid hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I slit open the summer school letter with a knife.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since I wasn't accepted for the writing course, it said, I could choose</p>
<p>some other course instead, but I should call in to the Admissions</p>
<p>Office that same morning, or it would be too late to register, the</p>
<p>courses were almost full.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I dialled the Admissions Office and listened to the zombie voice leave</p>
<p>a message that Miss Esther Greenwood was cancelling all arrangements to</p>
<p>come to summer school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I opened Buddy Willard's letter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy wrote that he was probably falling in love with a nurse who also</p>
<p>had TB, but his mother had rented a cottage in the Adirondacks for the</p>
<p>month of July, and if I came along with her, he might well find his</p>
<p>feeling for the nurse was a mere infatuation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I snatched up a pencil and crossed out Buddy's message.  Then I turned</p>
<p>the letter paper over and on the opposite side wrote that I was engaged</p>
<p>to a simultaneous interpreter and never wanted to see Buddy again as I</p>
<p>did not want to give my children a hypocrite for a father.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stuck the letter back in the envelope, scotch-taped it together, and</p>
<p>readdressed it to Buddy, without putting on a new stamp.  I thought the</p>
<p>message was worth a good three cents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I decided I would spend the summer writing a novel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That would fix a lot of people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I strolled into the kitchen, dropped a raw egg into a teacup of raw</p>
<p>hamburg, mixed it up and ate it.  Then I set up the card-table on the</p>
<p>screened breezeway between the house and the garage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A great wallowing bush of mock orange shut off the view of the street</p>
<p>in front, the house wall and the garage wall took care of either side,</p>
<p>and a clump of birches and a box hedge protected me from Mrs Ockenden</p>
<p>at the back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I counted out three hundred and fifty sheets of corrasable bond from my</p>
<p>mother's stock in the hall closet, secreted away under a pile of old</p>
<p>felt hats and clothes brushes and woollen scarves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back on the breezeway, I fed the first, virgin sheet into my old</p>
<p>portable and rolled it up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From another, distanced mind, I saw myself sitting on the breezeway,</p>
<p>surrounded by two white clapboard walls, a mock orange bush and a clump</p>
<p>of birches and a box hedge, small as a doll in a doll's house.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A feeling of tenderness filled my heart.  My heroine would be myself,</p>
<p>only in disguise.  She would be called Elaine.  Elaine.  I counted the</p>
<p>letters on my fingers.  There were six letters in Esther, too.  It</p>
<p>seemed a lucky thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>_Elaine sat on the breezeway in an old yellow nightgown of her</p>
<p>mother's, waiting for something to happen.  It was a sweltering morning</p>
<p>in July, and drops of sweat crawled down her back, one by one, like</p>
<p>slow insects._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I leaned back and read what I had written.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It seemed lively enough, and I was quite proud of the bit about the</p>
<p>drops of sweat like insects, only I had the dim impression I'd probably</p>
<p>read it somewhere else a long time ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat like that for about an hour, trying to think what would come</p>
<p>next, and in my mind, the barefoot doll in her mother's old yellow</p>
<p>nightgown sat and stared into space as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why honey, don't you want to get dressed?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother took care never to tell me to do anything.  She would only</p>
<p>reason with me sweetly, like one intelligent, mature person with</p>
<p>another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's almost three in the afternoon.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm writing a novel,' I said.  'I haven't got time to change out of</p>
<p>this and change into that.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lay on the couch on the breezeway and shut my eyes.  I could hear my</p>
<p>mother clearing the typewriter and the papers from the card-table and</p>
<p>laying out the silver for supper, but I didn't move.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>_Inertia oozed like molasses through Elaine's limbs.  That's what it</p>
<p>must feel like to have malaria, she thought._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At that rate, I'd be lucky if I wrote a page a day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I knew what the trouble was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I needed experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How could I write about life when I'd never had a love affair or a baby</p>
<p>or seen anybody die?  A girl I knew had just won a prize for a short</p>
<p>story about her adventures among the pygmies in Africa.  How could I</p>
<p>compete with that sort of thing?</p>
<p></p>
<p>By the end of supper my mother had convinced me I should study</p>
<p>shorthand in the evenings.  Then I would be killing two birds with one</p>
<p>stone, writing a novel and learning something practical as well.  I</p>
<p>would also be saving a whole lot of money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That same evening, my mother unearthed an old blackboard from the</p>
<p>cellar and set it up on the breezeway.  Then she stood at the</p>
<p>blackboard and scribbled little curlicues in white chalk while I sat in</p>
<p>a chair and watched.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first I felt hopeful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I might learn shorthand in no time, and when the freckled</p>
<p>lady in the Scholarhips Office asked me why I hadn't worked to earn</p>
<p>money in July and August, the way you were supposed to if you were a</p>
<p>scholarship girl, I could tell her I had taken a free shorthand course</p>
<p>instead, so I could support myself right after college.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only thing was, when I tried to picture myself in some job, briskly</p>
<p>jotting down line after line of shorthand, my mind went blank.  There</p>
<p>wasn't one job I felt like doing where you used shorthand.  And, as I</p>
<p>sat there and watched, the white chalk curlicues blurred into</p>
<p>senselessness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I told my mother I had a terrible headache, and went to bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An hour later the door inched open, and she crept into the room.  I</p>
<p>heard the whisper of her clothes as she undressed.  She climbed into</p>
<p>bed.  Then her breathing grew slow and regular.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the dim light of the streetlamp that filtered through the drawn</p>
<p>blinds, I could see the pin curls on her head glittering like a row of</p>
<p>little bayonets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided I would put off the novel until I had gone to Europe and had</p>
<p>a lover, and that I would never learn a word of shorthand.  If I never</p>
<p>learned shorthand I would never have to use it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I would spend the summer reading _Finnegan's Wake_ and</p>
<p>writing my thesis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I would be way ahead when college started at the end of September,</p>
<p>and able to enjoy my last year instead of swotting away with no make-up</p>
<p>and stringy hair, on a diet of coffee and benzedrine, the way most of</p>
<p>the seniors taking honours did, until they finished their thesis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I thought I might put off college for a year and apprentice myself</p>
<p>to a pottery maker.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or work my way to Germany and be a waitress, until I was bilingual.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then plan after plan started leaping through my head, like a family of</p>
<p>scatty rabbits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw the years of my life spaced along a road in the form of telephone</p>
<p>poles, threaded together by wires.  I counted one, two, three ...</p>
<p>nineteen telephone poles, and then the wires dangled into space, and</p>
<p>try as I would, I couldn't see a single pole beyond the nineteenth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The room blued into view, and I wondered where the night had gone.  My</p>
<p>mother turned from a foggy log into a slumbering, middle-aged woman,</p>
<p>her mouth slightly open and a snore ravelling from her throat.  The</p>
<p>piggish noise irritated me, and for a while it seemed to me that the</p>
<p>only way to stop it would be to take the column of skin and sinew from</p>
<p>which it rose and twist it to silence between my hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I feigned sleep until my mother left for school, but even my eyelids</p>
<p>didn't shut out the light.  They hung the raw, red screen of their tiny</p>
<p>vessels in front of me like a wound.  I crawled between the mattress</p>
<p>and the padded bedstead and let the mattress fall across me like a</p>
<p>tombstone.  It felt dark and safe under there, but the mattress was not</p>
<p>heavy enough.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It needed about a ton more weight to make me sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>_riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,</p>
<p>brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle</p>
<p>and Environs..._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The thick book made an unpleasant dent in my stomach.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>_riverrun, past Eve and Adam's..._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought the small letter at the start might mean that nothing ever</p>
<p>really began all new, with a capital, but that it just flowed on from</p>
<p>what came before.  Eve and Adam's was Adam and Eve, of course, but it</p>
<p>probably signified something else as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe it was a pub in Dublin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My eyes sank through an alphabet soup of letters to the long word in</p>
<p>the middle of the page.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>_bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnenonnruonnthu-</p>
<p>nntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!_</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I counted the letters.  There were exactly a hundred of them.  I</p>
<p>thought this must be important.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why should there be a hundred letters?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Haltingly, I tried the word aloud.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It sounded like a heavy wooden object falling downstairs, boomp boomp</p>
<p>boomp, step after step.  Lifting the pages of the book, I let them fan</p>
<p>slowly by my eyes.  Words, dimly familiar, but twisted all awry, like</p>
<p>faces in a funhouse mirror, fled past, leaving no impression on the</p>
<p>glassy surface of my brain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I squinted at the page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The letters grew barbs and rams' horns.  I watched them separate, each</p>
<p>from the other, and jiggle up and down in a silly way.  Then they</p>
<p>associated themselves in fantastic, untranslatable shapes, like Arabic</p>
<p>or Chinese.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to junk my thesis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to junk the whole honours programme and become an ordinary</p>
<p>English major.  I went to look up the requirements of an ordinary</p>
<p>English major at my college.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were lots of requirements, and I didn't have half of them.  One</p>
<p>of the requirements was a course in the eighteenth century.  I hated</p>
<p>the very idea of the eighteenth century, with all those smug men</p>
<p>writing tight little couplets and being so dead keen on reason.  So I'd</p>
<p>skipped it.  They let you do that in honours, you were much freer.  I</p>
<p>had been so free I'd spent most of my time on Dylan Thomas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A friend of mine, also in honours, had managed never to read a word of</p>
<p>Shakespeare; but she was a real expert on the _Four Quartets_.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw how impossible and embarrassing it would be for me to try to</p>
<p>switch from my free programme into the stricter one.  So I looked up</p>
<p>the requirements for English majors at the city college where my mother</p>
<p>taught.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were even worse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You had to know Old English and the History of the English Language and</p>
<p>a representative selection of all that had been written from Beowulf to</p>
<p>the present day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This surprised me.  I had always looked down on my mother's college, as</p>
<p>it was co-ed, and filled with people who couldn't get scholarships to</p>
<p>the big eastern colleges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I saw that the stupidest person at my mother's college knew more</p>
<p>than I did.  I saw they wouldn't even let me in through the door, let</p>
<p>alone give me a large scholarship like the one I had at my own college.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I'd better go to work for a year and think things over.</p>
<p>Maybe I could study the eighteenth century in secret.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I didn't know shorthand, so what could I do?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could be a waitress or a typist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I couldn't stand the idea of being either one.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'You say you want more sleeping pills?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But the ones I gave you last week are very strong.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They don't work any more.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teresa's large, dark eyes regarded me thoughtfully.  I could hear the</p>
<p>voices of her three children in the garden under the consulting-room</p>
<p>window.  My Aunt Libby had married an Italian, and Teresa was my aunt's</p>
<p>sister-in-law and our family doctor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I liked Teresa.  She had a gentle, intuitive touch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it must be because she was Italian.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What seems to be the matter?' Teresa said then.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't sleep.  I can't read.'  I tried to speak in a cool, calm way,</p>
<p>but the zombie rose up in my throat and choked me off.  I turned my</p>
<p>hands palm up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I think,' Teresa tore off a white slip from her prescription pad and</p>
<p>wrote down a name and address, 'you'd better see another doctor I know.</p>
<p>He'll be able to help you more than I can.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I peered at the writing, but I couldn't read it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Doctor Gordon,' Teresa said.  'He's a psychiatrist.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-11">
<h2>Chapter Eleven</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon's waiting-room was hushed and beige.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The walls were beige, and the carpets were beige, and the upholstered</p>
<p>chairs and sofas were beige.  There were no mirrors or pictures, only</p>
<p>certificates from different medical schools, with Doctor Gordon's name</p>
<p>in Latin, hung about the walls.  Pale green loopy ferns and spiked</p>
<p>leaves of a much darker green filled the ceramic pots on the end-table</p>
<p>and the coffee-table and the magazine-table.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first I wondered why the room felt so safe.  Then I realized it was</p>
<p>because there were no windows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The air-conditioning made me shiver.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was still wearing Betsy's white blouse and dirndl skirt.  They</p>
<p>drooped a bit now, as I hadn't washed them in my three weeks at home.</p>
<p>The sweaty cotton gave off a sour but friendly smell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't washed my hair for three weeks, either.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't slept for seven nights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother told me I must have slept, it was impossible not to sleep in</p>
<p>all that time, but if I slept, it was with my eyes wide open, for I had</p>
<p>followed the green, luminous course of the second hand and the minute</p>
<p>hand and the hour hand of the bedside clock through their circles and</p>
<p>semi-circles, every night for seven nights, without missing a second,</p>
<p>or a minute, or an hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason I hadn't washed my clothes or my hair was because it seemed</p>
<p>so silly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright,</p>
<p>white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a</p>
<p>black shade.  Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off</p>
<p>one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day</p>
<p>after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely</p>
<p>desolate avenue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again</p>
<p>the next.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It made me tired just to think of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon twiddled a silver pencil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Your mother tells me you are upset.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I curled in the cavernous leather chair and faced Doctor Gordon across</p>
<p>an acre of highly polished desk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon waited.  He tapped his pencil--tap, tap, tap--across the</p>
<p>neat green field of his blotter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His eyelashes were so long and thick they looked artificial.  Black</p>
<p>plastic reeds fringing two green, glacial pools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon's features were so perfect he was almost pretty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hated him the minute I walked in through the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had imagined a kind, ugly, intuitive man looking up and saying 'Ah!'</p>
<p>in an encouraging way, as if he could see something I couldn't, and</p>
<p>then I would find words to tell him how I was so scared, as if I were</p>
<p>being stuffed farther and farther into a black, airless sack with no</p>
<p>way out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he would lean back in his chair and match the tips of his fingers</p>
<p>together in a little steeple and tell me why I couldn't sleep and why I</p>
<p>couldn't read and why I couldn't eat and why everything people did</p>
<p>seemed so silly, because they only died in the end.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then, I thought, he would help me, step by step, to be myself again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Doctor Gordon wasn't like that at all.  He was young and</p>
<p>good-looking, and I could see right away he was conceited.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon had a photograph on his desk, in a silver frame, that</p>
<p>half faced him and half faced my leather chair.  It was a family</p>
<p>photograph, and it showed a beautiful dark-haired woman, who could have</p>
<p>been Doctor Gordon's sister, smiling out over the heads of two blond</p>
<p>children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think one child was a boy and one was a girl, but it may have been</p>
<p>that both children were boys or that both were girls, it is hard to</p>
<p>tell when children are so small.  I think there was also a dog in the</p>
<p>picture, towards the bottom--a kind of airedale or a golden</p>
<p>retriever--but it may have only been the pattern in the woman's skirt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For some reason the photograph made me furious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't see why it should be turned half towards me unless Doctor</p>
<p>Gordon was trying to show me right away that he was married to some</p>
<p>glamorous woman and I'd better not get any funny ideas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I thought, how could this Doctor Gordon help me anyway, with a</p>
<p>beautiful wife and beautiful children and a beautiful dog haloing him</p>
<p>like the angels on a Christmas card?</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Suppose you try and tell me what you think is wrong.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I turned the words over suspiciously, like round, sea-polished pebbles</p>
<p>that might suddenly put out a claw and change into something else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What did I _think_ was wrong?</p>
<p></p>
<p>That made it sound as if nothing was _really_ wrong, I only thought it</p>
<p>was wrong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a dull, flat voice--to show I was not beguiled by his good looks or</p>
<p>his family photograph--I told Doctor Gordon about not sleeping and not</p>
<p>eating and not reading.  I didn't tell him about the handwriting, which</p>
<p>bothered me most of all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That morning I had tried to write a letter to Doreen, down in West</p>
<p>Virginia, asking whether I could come and live with her and maybe get a</p>
<p>job at her college waiting on table or something.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when I took up my pen, my hand made big, jerky letters like those</p>
<p>of a child, and the lines sloped down the page from left to right</p>
<p>almost diagonally, as if they were loops of string lying on the paper,</p>
<p>and someone had come along and blown them askew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew I couldn't send a letter like that, so I tore it up in little</p>
<p>pieces and put them in my pocket-book, next to my all-purpose compact,</p>
<p>in case the psychiatrist asked to see them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But of course Doctor Gordon didn't ask to see them, as I hadn't</p>
<p>mentioned them, and I began to feel pleased at my cleverness.  I</p>
<p>thought I only need tell him what I wanted to, and that I could control</p>
<p>the picture he had of me by hiding this and revealing that, all the</p>
<p>while he thought he was so smart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The whole time I was talking, Doctor Gordon bent his head as if he were</p>
<p>praying, and the only noise apart from the dull, flat voice was the</p>
<p>tap, tap, tap of Doctor Gordon's pencil at the same point on the green</p>
<p>blotter, like a stalled walking-stick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I had finished, Doctor Gordon lifted his head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where did you say you went to college?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Baffled, I told him.  I didn't see where college fitted in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ah!'  Doctor Gordon leaned back in his chair, staring into the air</p>
<p>over my shoulder with a reminiscent smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought he was going to tell me his diagnosis, and that perhaps I had</p>
<p>judged him too hastily and too unkindly.  But he only said, 'I remember</p>
<p>your college well.  I was up there, during the war.  They had a WAC</p>
<p>station, didn't they?  Or was it WAVES?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said I didn't know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes, a WAC station, I remember now.  I was doctor for the lot, before</p>
<p>I was sent overseas.  My, they were a pretty bunch of girls.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon laughed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, in one smooth move, he rose to his feet and strolled towards me</p>
<p>round the corner of his desk.  I wasn't sure what he meant to do, so I</p>
<p>stood up as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon reached for the hand that hung at my right side and shook</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'See you next week, then.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The full, bosomy elms made a tunnel of shade over the yellow and red</p>
<p>brick fronts along Commonwealth Avenue, and a trolley-car was threading</p>
<p>itself towards Boston down its slim, silver track.  I waited for the</p>
<p>trolley to pass, then crossed to the grey Chevrolet at the opposite</p>
<p>curb.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could see my mother's face, anxious and sallow as a slice of lemon,</p>
<p>peering up at me through the windshield.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, what did he say?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pulled the car door shut.  It didn't catch.  I pushed it out and drew</p>
<p>it in again with a dull slam.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He said he'll see me next week.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother sighed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon cost twenty-five dollars an hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hi there, what's your name?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Elly Higginbottom.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sailor fell into step beside me, and I smiled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought there must be as many sailors on the Common as there were</p>
<p>pigeons.  They seemed to come out of a dun-coloured recruiting house on</p>
<p>the far side, with blue and white 'Join the Navy' posters stuck up on</p>
<p>billboards round it and all over the inner walls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where do you come from, Elly?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Chicago.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had never been to Chicago, but I knew one or two boys who went to</p>
<p>Chicago University, and it seemed the sort of place where</p>
<p>unconventional, mixed-up people would come from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You sure are a long way from home.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sailor put his arm around my waist, and for a long time we walked</p>
<p>around the Common like that, the sailor stroking my hip through the</p>
<p>green dirndl skirt, and me smiling mysteriously and trying not to say</p>
<p>anything that would show I was from Boston and might at any moment meet</p>
<p>Mrs Willard, or one of my mother's other friends, crossing the Common</p>
<p>after tea on Beacon Hill or shopping in Filene's Basement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought if I ever did get to Chicago, I might change my name to Elly</p>
<p>Higginbottom for good.  Then nobody would know I had thrown up a</p>
<p>scholarship at a big eastern women's college and mucked up a month in</p>
<p>New York and refused a perfectly solid medical student for a husband</p>
<p>who would one day be a member of the A.M.A. and earn pots of money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Chicago, people would take me for what I was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would be simple Elly Higginbottom, the orphan.  People would love me</p>
<p>for my sweet, quiet nature.  They wouldn't be after me to read books</p>
<p>and write long papers on the twins in James Joyce.  And one day I might</p>
<p>just marry a virile, but tender, garage mechanic and have a big cowy</p>
<p>family, like Dodo Conway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I happened to feel like it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you want to do when you get out of the Navy?' I asked the</p>
<p>sailor suddenly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was the longest sentence I had said, and he seemed taken aback.  He</p>
<p>pushed his white cup-cake cap to one side and scratched his head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, I dunno, Elly,' he said.  'I might just go to college on the</p>
<p>G.I. Bill.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I paused.  Then I said suggestively, 'You ever thought of opening a</p>
<p>garage?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nope,' said the sailor, 'Never have.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I peered at him from the corner of my eye.  He didn't look a day over</p>
<p>sixteen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you know how old I am?' I said accusingly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sailor grinned at me.  'Nope, and I don't care either.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>It occurred to me that this sailor was really remarkably handsome.  He</p>
<p>looked Nordic and virginal.  Now I was simple-minded it seemed I</p>
<p>attracted clean, handsome people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, I'm thirty,' I said, and waited.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Gee, Elly, you don't look it.'  The sailor squeezed my hip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he glanced quickly from left to right.  'Listen, Elly, if we go</p>
<p>round to those steps over there, under the monument, I can kiss you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>At that moment I noticed a brown figure in sensible flat brown shoes</p>
<p>striding across the Common in my direction.  From the distance, I</p>
<p>couldn't make out any features on the dime-sized face, but I knew it</p>
<p>was Mrs Willard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Could you please tell me the way to the subway?' I said to the sailor</p>
<p>in a loud voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Huh?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The subway that goes out to the Deer Island Prison?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Mrs Willard came up I would have to pretend I was only asking the</p>
<p>sailor directions, and didn't really know him at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Take your hands off me,' I said between my teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Say Elly, what's up?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman approached and passed by without a look or a nod, and of</p>
<p>course it wasn't Mrs Willard.  Mrs Willard was at her cottage in the</p>
<p>Adirondacks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I fixed the woman's receding back with a vengeful stare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Say, Elly...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I thought it was somebody I knew,' I said.  'Some blasted lady from</p>
<p>this orphan home in Chicago.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sailor put his arm around me again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You mean you got no mom and dad, Elly?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.'  I let out a tear that seemed ready.  It made a little hot track</p>
<p>down my cheek.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Say Elly, don't cry.  This lady, was she mean to you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She was ... she was _awful_!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The tears came in a rush, then, and while the sailor was holding me and</p>
<p>patting them dry with a big, clean, white, linen handkerchief in the</p>
<p>shelter of an American elm, I thought what an awful woman that lady in</p>
<p>the brown suit had been, and how she, whether she knew it or not, was</p>
<p>responsible for my taking the wrong turn here and the wrong path there</p>
<p>and for everything bad that happened after that.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, Esther, how do you feel this week?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon cradled his pencil like a slim, silver bullet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The same.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The same?'  He quirked an eyebrow, as if he didn't believe it,</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I told him again, in the same dull, flat voice, only it was angrier</p>
<p>this time, because he seemed so slow to understand, how I hadn't slept</p>
<p>for fourteen nights and how I couldn't read or write or swallow very</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon seemed unimpressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I dug into my pocket-book and found the scraps of my letter to Doreen.</p>
<p>I took them out and let them flutter on to Doctor Gordon's immaculate</p>
<p>green blotter.  They lay there, dumb as daisy petals in a summer meadow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What,' I said, 'do you think of that?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought Doctor Gordon must immediately see how bad the handwriting</p>
<p>was, but he only said, 'I think I would like to speak to your mother.</p>
<p>Do you mind?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.'  But I didn't like the idea of Doctor Gordon talking to my mother</p>
<p>one bit.  I thought he might tell her I should be locked up.  I picked</p>
<p>up every scrap of my letter to Doreen, so Doctor Gordon couldn't piece</p>
<p>them together and see I was planning to run away, and walked out of his</p>
<p>office without another word.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I watched my mother grow smaller and smaller until she disappeared into</p>
<p>the door of Doctor Gordon's office building.  Then I watched her grow</p>
<p>larger and larger as she came back to the car.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well?'  I could tell she had been crying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother didn't look at me.  She started the car.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then she said, as we glided under the cool, deep-sea shade of the elms,</p>
<p>'Doctor Gordon doesn't think you've improved at all.  He thinks you</p>
<p>should have some shock treatments at his private hospital in Walton.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt a sharp stab of curiosity, as if I had just read a terrible</p>
<p>newspaper headline about somebody else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Does he mean live there?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' my mother said, and her chin quivered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought she must be lying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You tell me the truth,' I said, 'or I'll never speak to you again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't I _al_ways tell you the truth?' my mother said, and burst into</p>
<p>tears.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>SUICIDE SAVED FROM SEVEN-STOREY LEDGE!</p>
<p></p>
<p>_After two hours on a narrow ledge seven storeys above a concrete</p>
<p>parking lot and gathered crowds, Mr George Pollucci let himself be</p>
<p>helped to safety through a nearby window by Sgt. Will Kilmartin of the</p>
<p>Charles Street police force._</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I cracked open a peanut from the ten cent bag I had bought to feed the</p>
<p>pigeons, and ate it.  It tasted dead, like a bit of old tree bark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I brought the newspaper close up to my eyes to get a better view of</p>
<p>George Pollucci's face, spotlighted like a three-quarter moon against a</p>
<p>vague background of brick and black sky.  I felt he had something</p>
<p>important to tell me, and that whatever it was might just be written on</p>
<p>his face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the smudgy crags of George Pollucci's features melted away as I</p>
<p>peered at them, and resolved themselves into a regular pattern of dark</p>
<p>and light and medium grey dots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The inky black newspaper paragraph didn't tell why Mr Pollucci was on</p>
<p>the ledge, or what Sgt. Kilmartin did to him when he finally got him in</p>
<p>through the window.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The trouble about jumping was that if you didn't pick the right number</p>
<p>of storeys, you might still be alive when you hit bottom.  I thought</p>
<p>seven storeys must be a safe distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I folded the paper and wedged it between the slats of the park bench.</p>
<p>It was what my mother called a scandal sheet, full of the local murders</p>
<p>and suicides and beatings and robbings, and just about every page had a</p>
<p>half-naked lady on it with her breasts surging over the edge of her</p>
<p>dress and her legs arranged so you could see to her stocking tops.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn't know why I had never bought any of these papers before.  They</p>
<p>were the only things I could read.  The little paragraphs between the</p>
<p>pictures ended before the letters had a chance to get cocky and wiggle</p>
<p>about.  At home, all I ever saw was the _Christian Science Monitor_,</p>
<p>which appeared on the doorstep at five o'clock every day but Sunday and</p>
<p>treated suicides and sex crimes and aeroplane crashes as if they didn't</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A big white swan full of little children approached my bench, then</p>
<p>turned round a bosky islet covered with ducks and paddled back under</p>
<p>the dark arch of the bridge.  Everything I looked at seemed bright and</p>
<p>extremely tiny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw, as if through the keyhole of a door I couldn't open, myself and</p>
<p>my younger brother, knee-high and holding rabbit-eared balloons, climb</p>
<p>aboard a swanboat and fight for a seat at the edge, over the</p>
<p>peanut-shell-paved water.  My mouth tasted of cleanness and peppermint.</p>
<p>If we were good at the dentist's, my mother always bought us a swanboat</p>
<p>ride.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I circled the Public Garden--over the bridge and under the blue-green</p>
<p>monuments, past the American flag flower-bed and the entrance where you</p>
<p>could have your picture taken in an orange-and-white striped canvas</p>
<p>booth for twenty-five cents--reading the names of the trees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My favourite tree was the Weeping Scholar Tree.  I thought it must come</p>
<p>from Japan.  They understood things of the spirit in Japan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They disembowelled themselves when anything went wrong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to imagine how they would go about it.  They must have an</p>
<p>extremely sharp knife.  No, probably two extremely sharp knives.  Then</p>
<p>they would sit down, cross-legged, a knife in either hand.  Then they</p>
<p>would cross their hands and point a knife at each side of their</p>
<p>stomach.  They would have to be naked, or the knife would get stuck in</p>
<p>their clothes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then in one quick flash, before they had time to think twice, they</p>
<p>would jab the knives in and zip them round, one on the upper crescent</p>
<p>and one on the lower crescent, making a full circle.  Then their</p>
<p>stomach skin would come loose, like a plate, and their insides would</p>
<p>fall out, and they would die.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It must take a lot of courage to die like that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My trouble was I hated the sight of blood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I might stay in the park all night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next morning Dodo Conway was driving my mother and me to Walton,</p>
<p>and if I was to run away before it was too late, now was the time.  I</p>
<p>looked in my pocket-book and counted out a dollar bill and seventy-nine</p>
<p>cents in dimes and nickels and pennies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had no idea how much it would cost to get to Chicago, and I didn't</p>
<p>dare go to the bank and draw out all my money, because I thought Doctor</p>
<p>Gordon might well have warned the bank clerk to intercept me if I made</p>
<p>any obvious move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hitch-hiking occurred to me, but I had no idea which of all the routes</p>
<p>out of Boston led to Chicago.  It's easy enough to find directions on a</p>
<p>map, but I had very little knowledge of directions when I was smack in</p>
<p>the middle of somewhere.  Every time I wanted to figure what was east</p>
<p>or what was west it seemed to be noon, or cloudy, which was no help at</p>
<p>all, or night-time, and except for the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia's</p>
<p>Chair, I was hopeless at stars, a failing which always disheartened</p>
<p>Buddy Willard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to walk to the bus terminal and inquire about the fares to</p>
<p>Chicago.  Then I might go to the bank and withdraw precisely that</p>
<p>amount, which would not cause so much suspicion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had just strolled in through the glass doors of the terminal and was</p>
<p>browsing over the rack of coloured tour leaflets and schedules, when I</p>
<p>realized that the bank in my home town would be closed, as it was</p>
<p>already mid-afternoon, and I couldn't get any money out till the next</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My appointment at Walton was for ten o'clock.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At that moment, the loudspeaker crackled into life and started</p>
<p>announcing the stops of a bus getting ready to leave in the parking lot</p>
<p>outside.  The voice on the loudspeaker went bockle bockle bockle, the</p>
<p>way they do, so you can't understand a word, and then, in the middle of</p>
<p>all the static, I heard a familiar name clear as _A_ on the piano in</p>
<p>the middle of all the tuning instruments of an orchestra.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a stop two blocks from my house.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hurried out into the hot, dusty, end-of-July afternoon, sweating and</p>
<p>sandy-mouthed, as if late for a difficult interview, and boarded the</p>
<p>red bus, whose motor was already running.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I handed my fare to the driver, and silently, on gloved hinges, the</p>
<p>door folded shut at my back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-12">
<h2>Chapter Twelve</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon's private hospital crowned a grassy rise at the end of a</p>
<p>long, secluded drive that had been whitened with broken quahog shells.</p>
<p>The yellow clapboard walls of the large house, with its encircling</p>
<p>veranda, gleamed in the sun, but no people strolled on the green dome</p>
<p>of the lawn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As my mother and I approached the summer heat bore down on us, and a</p>
<p>cicada started up, like an aerial lawnmower, in the heart of a copper</p>
<p>beech tree at the back.  The sound of the cicada only served to</p>
<p>underline the enormous silence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A nurse met us at the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Will you wait in the living-room, please.  Doctor Gordon will be with</p>
<p>you presently.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>What bothered me was that everything about the house seemed normal,</p>
<p>although I knew it must be chock-full of crazy people.  There were no</p>
<p>bars on the windows that I could see, and no wild or disquieting</p>
<p>noises.  Sunlight measured itself out in regular oblongs on the shabby,</p>
<p>but soft red carpets, and a whiff of fresh-cut grass sweetened the air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I paused in the doorway of the living-room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute I thought it was the replica of a lounge in a guest house</p>
<p>I visited once on an island off the coast of Maine.  The French doors</p>
<p>let in a dazzle of white light, a grand piano ruled the far corner of</p>
<p>the room, and people in summer clothes were sitting about at card</p>
<p>tables and in the lopsided wicker armchairs one so often finds at</p>
<p>down-at-heel seaside resorts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I realized that none of the people were moving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I focused more closely, trying to pry some clue from their stiff</p>
<p>postures.  I made out men and women, and boys and girls who must be as</p>
<p>young as I, but there was a uniformity to their faces, as if they had</p>
<p>lain for a long time on a shelf, out of the sunlight, under siftings of</p>
<p>pale, fine dust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I saw that some of the people were indeed moving, but with such</p>
<p>small, birdlike gestures I had not at first discerned them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A grey-faced man was counting out a deck of cards, one, two, three,</p>
<p>four...  I thought he must be seeing if it was a full pack, but when he</p>
<p>had finished counting, he started over again.  Next to him, a fat lady</p>
<p>played with a string of wooden beads.  She drew all the beads up to one</p>
<p>end of the string.  Then click, click, click, she let them fall back on</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the piano, a young girl leafed through a few sheets of music, but</p>
<p>when she saw me looking at her, she ducked her head crossly and tore</p>
<p>the sheets in half.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother touched my arm, and I followed her into the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We sat, without speaking, on a lumpy sofa that creaked each time one</p>
<p>stirred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then my gaze slid over the people to the blaze of green beyond the</p>
<p>diaphanous curtains, and I felt as if I were sitting in the window of</p>
<p>an enormous department store.  The figures around me weren't people,</p>
<p>but shop dummies, painted to resemble people and propped up in</p>
<p>attitudes counterfeiting life.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I climbed after Doctor Gordon's dark-jacketed back.  Downstairs, in the</p>
<p>hall, I had tried to ask him what the shock treatment would be like,</p>
<p>but when I opened my mouth no words came out, my eyes only widened and</p>
<p>stared at the smiling, familiar face that floated before me like a</p>
<p>plate full of assurances.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the top of the stairs, the garnet-coloured carpet stopped.  A plain,</p>
<p>brown linoleum, tacked to the floor, took its place, and extended down</p>
<p>a corridor lined with shut white doors.  As I followed Doctor Gordon, a</p>
<p>door opened somewhere in the distance, and I heard a woman shouting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All at once a nurse popped around the corner of the corridor ahead of</p>
<p>us leading a woman in a blue bathrobe with shaggy, waist-length hair.</p>
<p>Doctor Gordon stepped back, and I flattened against the wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the woman was dragged by, waving her arms and struggling in the grip</p>
<p>of the nurse, she was saying, 'I'm going to jump out of the window, I'm</p>
<p>going to jump out of the window, I'm going to jump out of the window.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dumpy and muscular in her smudge-fronted uniform, the wall-eyed nurse</p>
<p>wore such thick spectacles that four eyes peered out at me from behind</p>
<p>the round, twin panes of glass.  I was trying to tell which eyes were</p>
<p>the real eyes and which the false eyes, and which of the real eyes was</p>
<p>the wall-eye and which the straight eye, when she brought her face up</p>
<p>to mine with a large, conspiratorial grin and hissed, as if to reassure</p>
<p>me, 'She thinks she's going to jump out the window but she can't jump</p>
<p>out the window because they're all barred!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And as Doctor Gordon led me into a bare room at the back of the house,</p>
<p>I saw that the windows in that part were indeed barred, and that the</p>
<p>room door and the closet door and the drawers of the bureau and</p>
<p>everything that opened and shut was fitted with a keyhole so it could</p>
<p>be locked up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lay down on the bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The wall-eyed nurse came back.  She unclasped my watch and dropped it</p>
<p>in her pocket.  Then she started tweaking the hairpins from my hair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon was unlocking the closet.  He dragged out a table on</p>
<p>wheels with a machine on it and rolled it behind the head of the bed.</p>
<p>The nurse started swabbing my temples with a smelly grease.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As she leaned over to reach the side of my head nearest the wall, her</p>
<p>fat breast muffled my face like a cloud or a pillow.  A vague,</p>
<p>medicinal stench emanated from her flesh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't worry,' the nurse grinned down at me.  'Their first time</p>
<p>everybody's scared to death.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to smile, but my skin had gone stiff, like parchment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Gordon was fitting two metal plates on either side of my head.</p>
<p>He buckled them into place with a strap that dented my forehead, and</p>
<p>gave me a wire to bite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shut my eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a brief silence, like an indrawn breath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end</p>
<p>of the world.  Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling</p>
<p>with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I</p>
<p>thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split</p>
<p>plant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I was sitting in a wicker chair, holding a small cocktail glass of</p>
<p>tomato juice.  The watch had been replaced on my wrist, but it looked</p>
<p>odd.  Then I realized it had been fastened upside down.  I sensed the</p>
<p>unfamiliar positioning of the hairpins in my hair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How do you feel?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>An old metal floor lamp surfaced in my mind.  One of the few relics of</p>
<p>my father's study, it was surmounted by a copper bell which held the</p>
<p>light bulb, and from which a frayed, tiger-coloured cord ran down the</p>
<p>length of the metal stand to a socket in the wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One day I'd decided to move this lamp from the side of my mother's bed</p>
<p>to my desk at the other end of the room.  The cord would be long</p>
<p>enough, so I didn't unplug it.  I closed both hands around the lamp and</p>
<p>the fuzzy cord and gripped them tight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then something leapt out of the lamp in a blue flash and shook me till</p>
<p>my teeth rattled, and I tried to pull my hands off, but they were</p>
<p>stuck, and I screamed, or a scream was torn from my throat, for I</p>
<p>didn't recognize it, but heard it soar and quaver in the air like a</p>
<p>violently disembodied spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then my hands jerked free, and I fell back on to my mother's bed.  A</p>
<p>small hole, blackened as if with pencil lead, pitted the centre of my</p>
<p>right palm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How do you feel?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'All right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I didn't.  I felt terrible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Which college did you say you went to?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said what college it was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ah!'  Doctor Gordon's face lighted with a slow, almost tropical smile.</p>
<p>'They had a WAC station up there, didn't they, during the war?'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother's knuckles were bone-white, as if the skin had worn off them</p>
<p>in the hour of waiting.  She looked past me to Doctor Gordon, and he</p>
<p>must have nodded, or smiled, because her face relaxed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A few more shock treatments, Mrs Greenwood,' I heard Doctor Gordon</p>
<p>say, 'and I think you'll notice a wonderful improvement.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The girl was still sitting on the piano stool, the torn sheet of music</p>
<p>splayed at her feet like a dead bird.  She stared at me, and I stared</p>
<p>back.  Her eyes narrowed.  She stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother was following Doctor Gordon to the door.  I lingered behind,</p>
<p>and when their backs were turned, I rounded on the girl and thumbed</p>
<p>both ears at her.  She pulled her tongue in, and her face went stony.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I walked out into the sun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Panther-like in a dapple of tree shadow, Dodo Conway's black station</p>
<p>wagon lay in wait.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The station wagon had been ordered originally by a wealthy society</p>
<p>lady, black, without a speck of chrome, and with black leather</p>
<p>upholstery, but when it came, it depressed her.  It was the dead spit</p>
<p>of a hearse, she said, and everybody else thought so too, and nobody</p>
<p>would buy it, so the Conways drove it home, cut-price, and saved</p>
<p>themselves a couple of hundred dollars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sitting in the front seat, between Dodo and my mother, I felt dumb and</p>
<p>subdued.  Every time I tried to concentrate, my mind glided off, like a</p>
<p>skater, into a large empty space, and pirouetted there, absently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm through with that Doctor Gordon,' I said, after we had left Dodo</p>
<p>and her black wagon behind the pines.  'You can call him up and tell</p>
<p>him I'm not coming next week.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother smiled.  'I knew my baby wasn't like that.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at her.  'Like what?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Like those awful people.  Those awful dead people at that hospital.'</p>
<p>She paused.  'I knew you'd decide to be all right again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>STARLET SUCCUMBS AFTER SIXTY-EIGHT HOUR COMA.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt in my pocket-book among the paper scraps and the compact and the</p>
<p>peanut shells and the dimes and nickels and the blue jiffy box</p>
<p>containing nineteen Gillette blades, till I unearthed the snapshot I'd</p>
<p>had taken that afternoon in the orange-and-white striped booth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I brought it up next to the smudgy photograph of the dead girl.  It</p>
<p>matched, mouth for mouth, nose for nose.  The only difference was the</p>
<p>eyes.  The eyes in the snapshot were open, and those in the newspaper</p>
<p>photograph were closed.  But I knew if the dead girl's eyes were to be</p>
<p>thumbed wide, they would look out at me with the same dead, black,</p>
<p>vacant expression as the eyes in the snapshot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stuffed the snapshot back in my pocket-book.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I will just sit here in the sun on this park bench five minutes more</p>
<p>by the clock on that building over there,' I told myself, 'and then I</p>
<p>will go somewhere and do it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I summoned my little chorus of voices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>_Doesn't your work interest you, Esther?_</p>
<p></p>
<p>_You know, Esther, you've got the perfect set-up of a true neurotic._</p>
<p></p>
<p>_You'll never get anywhere like that, you'll never get anywhere like</p>
<p>that, you'll never get anywhere like that._</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once, on a hot summer night, I had spent an hour kissing a hairy,</p>
<p>ape-shaped law student from Yale because I felt sorry for him, he was</p>
<p>so ugly.  When I had finished, he said, 'I have you taped, baby.</p>
<p>You'll be a prude at forty.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Factitious!' my creative writing professor at college scrawled on a</p>
<p>story of mine called 'The Big Weekend'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't known what factitious meant, so I looked it up in the</p>
<p>dictionary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Factitious, artificial, sham.</p>
<p></p>
<p>_You'll never get anywhere like that._</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't slept for twenty-one nights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow, the</p>
<p>million moving shapes and cul-de-sacs of shadow.  There was shadow in</p>
<p>bureau drawers and closets and suitcases, and shadow under houses and</p>
<p>trees and stones, and shadow at the back of people's eyes and smiles,</p>
<p>and shadow, miles and miles and miles of it, on the night side of the</p>
<p>earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked down at the two flesh-coloured band-aids forming a cross on</p>
<p>the calf of my right leg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That morning I had made a start.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had locked myself in the bathroom, and run a tub full of warm water,</p>
<p>and taken out a Gillette blade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When they asked some old Roman philosopher or other how he wanted to</p>
<p>die, he said he would open his veins in a warm bath.  I thought it</p>
<p>would be easy, lying in the tub and seeing the redness flower from my</p>
<p>wrists, flush after flush through the clear water, till I sank to sleep</p>
<p>under a surface gaudy as poppies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white</p>
<p>and defenceless that I couldn't do it.  It was as if what I wanted to</p>
<p>kill wasn't in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my</p>
<p>thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder</p>
<p>to get at.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It would take two motions.  One wrist, then the other wrist.  Three</p>
<p>motions, if you counted changing the razor from hand to hand.  Then I</p>
<p>would step into the tub and lie down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I moved in front of the medicine cabinet.  If I looked in the mirror</p>
<p>while I did it, it would be like watching somebody else, in a book or a</p>
<p>play.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the person in the mirror was paralysed and too stupid to do a thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I thought, maybe I ought to spill a little blood for practice, so</p>
<p>I sat on the edge of the tub and crossed my right ankle over my left</p>
<p>knee.  Then I lifted my right hand with the razor and let it drop of</p>
<p>its own weight, like a guillotine, on to the calf of my leg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt nothing.  Then I felt a small, deep thrill, and a bright seam of</p>
<p>red welled up at the lip of the slash.  The blood gathered darkly, like</p>
<p>fruit, and rolled down my ankle into the cup of my black patent leather</p>
<p>shoe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought of getting into the tub then, but I realized my dallying had</p>
<p>used up the better part of the morning, and that my mother would</p>
<p>probably come home and find me before I was done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I bandaged the cut, packed up my Gillette blades and caught the</p>
<p>eleven-thirty bus to Boston.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Sorry, baby, there's no subway to the Deer Island Prison, it's on a</p>
<p>niland.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, it's not on an island, it used to be on an island, but they filled</p>
<p>up the water with dirt and now it joins on to the mainland.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'There's no subway.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've got to get there.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey,' the fat man in the ticket booth peered at me through the</p>
<p>grating, 'don't cry.  Who you got there, honey, some relative?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>People shoved and bumped by me in the artificially lit dark, hurrying</p>
<p>after the trains that rumbled in and out of the intestinal tunnels</p>
<p>under Scollay Square.  I could feel the tears start to spurt from the</p>
<p>screwed-up nozzles of my eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's my _fa_ther.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fat man consulted a diagram on the wall of his booth.  'Here's how</p>
<p>you do,' he said, 'you take a car from that track over there and get</p>
<p>off at Orient Heights and then hop a bus with The Point on it.'  He</p>
<p>beamed at me.  'It'll run you straight to the prison gate.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey you!'  A young fellow in a blue uniform waved from the hut.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I waved back and kept on going.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey you!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stopped, and walked slowly over to the hut that perched like a</p>
<p>circular living-room on the waste of sands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey, you can't go any further.  That's prison property, no trespassers</p>
<p>allowed.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I thought you could go anyplace along the beach,' I said.  'So long as</p>
<p>you stayed under the tideline.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fellow thought a minute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he said, 'Not this beach.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He had a pleasant, fresh face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You've a nice place here,' I said.  'It's like a little house.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He glanced back into the room, with its braided rug and chintz</p>
<p>curtains.  He smiled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'We even got a coffee pot.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I used to live near here.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No kidding.  I was born and brought up in this town myself.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked across the sands to the parking lot and the barred gate, and</p>
<p>past the barred gate to the narrow road, lapped by the ocean on both</p>
<p>sides, that led out to the one-time island.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The red brick buildings of the prison looked friendly, like the</p>
<p>buildings of a seaside college.  On a green hump of lawn to the left, I</p>
<p>could see small white spots and slightly larger pink spots moving</p>
<p>about.  I asked the guard what they were, and he said, 'Them's pigs 'n'</p>
<p>chickens.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was thinking that if I'd had the sense to go on living in that old</p>
<p>town I might just have met this prison guard in school and married him</p>
<p>and had a parcel of kids by now.  It would be nice, living by the sea</p>
<p>with piles of little kids and pigs and chickens, wearing what my</p>
<p>grandmother called wash dresses, and sitting about in some kitchen with</p>
<p>bright linoleum and fat arms, drinking pots of coffee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How do you get into that prison?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You get a pass.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, how do you get _locked_ in?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh,' the guard laughed, 'you steal a car, you rob a store.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You got any murderers in there?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.  Murderers go to a big state place.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who else is in there?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, the first day of winter we get these old bums out of Boston.</p>
<p>They heave a brick through a window, and then they get picked up and</p>
<p>spend the winter out of the cold, with TV and plenty to eat, and</p>
<p>basketball games on the weekend.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's nice.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nice if you like it,' said the guard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said good-bye and started to move off, glancing back over my shoulder</p>
<p>only once.  The guard still stood in the doorway of his observation</p>
<p>booth, and when I turned he lifted his arm in a salute.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The log I sat on was lead-heavy and smelled of tar.  Under the stout,</p>
<p>grey cylinder of the water tower on its commanding hill, the sandbar</p>
<p>curved out into the sea.  At high tide the bar completely submerged</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remembered that sandbar well.  It harboured, in the crook of its</p>
<p>inner curve, a particular shell that could be found nowhere else on the</p>
<p>beach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The shell was thick, smooth, big as a thumb joint, and usually white,</p>
<p>although sometimes pink or peach-coloured.  It resembled a sort of</p>
<p>modest conch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mummy, that girl's _still_ sitting there.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked up, idly, and saw a small, sandy child being dragged up from</p>
<p>the sea's edge by a skinny, bird-eyed woman in red shorts and a</p>
<p>red-and-white polka-dotted halter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't counted on the beach being overrun with summer people.  In the</p>
<p>ten years of my absence, fancy blue and pink and pale green shanties</p>
<p>had sprung up on the flat sands of the Point like a crop of tasteless</p>
<p>mushrooms, and the silver aeroplanes and cigar-shaped blimps had given</p>
<p>way to jets that scoured the rooftops in their loud onrush from the</p>
<p>airport across the bay.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was the only girl on the beach in a skirt and high heels, and it</p>
<p>occurred to me I must stand out.  I had removed my patent leather shoes</p>
<p>after a while, for they foundered badly in the sand.  It pleased me to</p>
<p>think they would be perched there on the silver log, pointing out to</p>
<p>sea, like a sort of soul-compass, after I was dead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I fingered the box of razors in my pocket-book.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I thought how stupid I was.  I had the razors, but no warm bath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I considered renting a room.  There must be a boarding house among all</p>
<p>those summer places.  But I had no luggage.  That would create</p>
<p>suspicion.  Besides, in a boarding house other people are always</p>
<p>wanting to use the bathroom.  I'd hardly have time to do it and step</p>
<p>into the tub when somebody would be pounding at the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The gulls on their wooden stilts at the tip of the bar miaowed like</p>
<p>cats.  Then they flapped up, one by one, in their ash-coloured jackets,</p>
<p>circling my head and crying.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Say, lady, you better not sit out here, the tide's coming in.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The small boy squatted a few feet away.  He picked up a round purple</p>
<p>stone and lobbed it into the water.  The water swallowed it with a</p>
<p>resonant plop.  Then he scrabbled around, and I heard the dry stones</p>
<p>clank together like money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He skimmed a flat stone over the dull green surface, and it skipped</p>
<p>seven times before it sliced out of sight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why don't you go home?' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The boy skipped another, heavier stone.  It sank after the second</p>
<p>bounce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't want to.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Your mother's looking for you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She is not.'  He sounded worried.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'If you go home, I'll give you some candy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The boy hitched closer.  'What kind?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I knew without looking into my pocket-book that all I had was</p>
<p>peanut shells.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll give you some money to buy some candy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ar-_thur_!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>A woman was indeed coming out on the sandbar, slipping and no doubt</p>
<p>cursing to herself, for her lips went up and down between her clear,</p>
<p>peremptory calls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ar-_thur_!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>She shaded her eyes with one hand, as if this helped her discern us</p>
<p>through the thickening sea dusk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could sense the boy's interest dwindle as the pull of his mother</p>
<p>increased.  He began to pretend he didn't know me.  He kicked over a</p>
<p>few stones, as if searching for something, and edged off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shivered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stones lay lumpish and cold under my bare feet.  I thought</p>
<p>longingly of the black shoes on the beach.  A wave drew back, like a</p>
<p>hand, then advanced and touched my foot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The drench seemed to come off the sea floor itself, where blind white</p>
<p>fish ferried themselves by their own light through the great polar</p>
<p>cold.  I saw sharks' teeth and whales' earbones littered about down</p>
<p>there like gravestones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I waited, as if the sea could make my decision for me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A second wave collapsed over my feet, lipped with white froth, and the</p>
<p>chill gripped my ankles with a mortal ache.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My flesh winced, in cowardice, from such a death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I picked up my pocket-book and started back over the cold stones to</p>
<p>where my shoes kept their vigil in the violet light.</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirteen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course his mother killed him.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at the mouth of the boy Jody had wanted me to meet.  His lips</p>
<p>were thick and pink and a baby face nestled under the silk of</p>
<p>white-blond hair.  His name was Cal, which I thought must be short for</p>
<p>something, but I couldn't think what it would be short for, unless it</p>
<p>was California.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How can you be sure she killed him?' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cal was supposed to be very intelligent, and Jody had said over the</p>
<p>phone that he was cute and I would like him.  I wondered, if I'd been</p>
<p>my old self, if I would have liked him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was impossible to tell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, first she says No no no, and then she says Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But then she says No no again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cal and I lay side by side on an orange and green striped towel on a</p>
<p>mucky beach across the swamps from Lynn.  Jody and Mark, the boy she</p>
<p>was pinned to, were swimming.  Cal hadn't wanted to swim, he had wanted</p>
<p>to talk, and we were arguing about this play where a young man finds</p>
<p>out he has a brain disease, on account of his father fooling around</p>
<p>with unclean women, and in the end his brain, which has been softening</p>
<p>all along, snaps completely, and his mother is debating whether to kill</p>
<p>him or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a suspicion that my mother had called Jody and begged her to ask</p>
<p>me out, so I wouldn't sit around in my room all day with the shades</p>
<p>drawn.  I didn't want to go at first, because I thought Jody would</p>
<p>notice the change in me, and that anybody with half an eye would see I</p>
<p>didn't have a brain in my head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But all during the drive north, and then east, Jody had joked and</p>
<p>laughed and chattered and not seemed to mind that I only said, 'My' or</p>
<p>'Gosh' or 'You don't say'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We browned hotdogs on the public grills at the beach, and by watching</p>
<p>Jody and Mark and Cal very carefully I managed to cook my hotdog just</p>
<p>the right amount of time and didn't burn it or drop it into the fire,</p>
<p>the way I was afraid of doing.  Then, when nobody was looking, I buried</p>
<p>it in the sand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After we ate, Jody and Mark ran down to the water hand-in-hand, and I</p>
<p>lay back, staring into the sky, while Cal went on and on about this</p>
<p>play.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only reason I remembered this play was because it had a mad person</p>
<p>in it, and everything I had ever read about mad people stuck in my</p>
<p>mind, while everything else flew out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But it's the Yes that matters,' Cal said.  'It's the Yes she'll come</p>
<p>back to in the end.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lifted my head and squinted out at the bright blue plate of the</p>
<p>sea--a bright blue plate with a dirty rim.  A big round grey rock, like</p>
<p>the upper half of an egg, poked out of the water about a mile from the</p>
<p>stony headland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What was she going to kill him with?  I forget.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't forgotten.  I remembered perfectly well, but I wanted to hear</p>
<p>what Cal would say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Morphia powders.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you suppose they have morphia powders in America?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cal considered a minute.  Then he said, 'I wouldn't think so.  They</p>
<p>sound awfully old-fashioned.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I rolled over on to my stomach and squinted at the view in the other</p>
<p>direction, towards Lynn.  A glassy haze rippled up from the fires in</p>
<p>the grills and the heat on the road, and through the haze, as through a</p>
<p>curtain of clear water, I could make out a smudgy skyline of gas tanks</p>
<p>and factory stacks and derricks and bridges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It looked one hell of a mess.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I rolled on to my back again and made my voice casual.  'If you were</p>
<p>going to kill yourself, how would you do it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cal seemed pleased.  'I've often thought of that.  I'd blow my brains</p>
<p>out with a gun.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was disappointed.  It was just like a man to do it with a gun.  A fat</p>
<p>chance I had of laying my hands on a gun.  And even if I did, I</p>
<p>wouldn't have a clue as to what part of me to shoot at.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd already read in the papers about people who'd tried to shoot</p>
<p>themselves, only they ended up shooting an important nerve and getting</p>
<p>paralysed, or blasting their face off, but being saved, by surgeons and</p>
<p>a sort of miracle, from dying outright.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The risks of a gun seemed great.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What kind of a gun?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My father's shotgun.  He keeps it loaded.  I'd just have to walk into</p>
<p>his study one day and,' Cal pointed a finger to his temple and made a</p>
<p>comical, screwed-up face, 'click!'  He widened his pale grey eyes and</p>
<p>looked at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Does your father happen to live near Boston?' I asked idly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nope.  In Clacton-on-Sea.  He's English.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jody and Mark ran up hand-in-hand, dripping and shaking off water drops</p>
<p>like two loving puppies.  I thought there would be too many people, so</p>
<p>I stood up and pretended to yawn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I guess I'll go for a swim.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being with Jody and Mark and Cal was beginning to weigh on my nerves,</p>
<p>like a dull wooden block on the strings of a piano.  I was afraid that</p>
<p>at any moment my control would snap, and I would start babbling about</p>
<p>how I couldn't read and couldn't write and how I must be just about the</p>
<p>only person who had stayed awake for a solid month without dropping</p>
<p>dead of exhaustion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A smoke seemed to be going up from my nerves like the smoke from the</p>
<p>grills and the sun-saturated road.  The whole landscape--beach and</p>
<p>headland and sea and rock--quavered in front of my eyes like a stage</p>
<p>backcloth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wondered at what point in space the silly, sham blue of the sky</p>
<p>turned black.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You swim too, Cal.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jody gave Cal a playful little push.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ohhh,' Cal hid his face in the towel.  'It's too cold.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I started to walk towards the water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somehow, in the broad, shadowless light of noon, the water looked</p>
<p>amiable and welcoming.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought drowning must be the kindest way to die, and burning the</p>
<p>worst.  Some of those babies in the jars that Buddy Willard showed me</p>
<p>had gills, he said.  They went through a stage where they were just</p>
<p>like fish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A little, rubbishy wavelet, full of candy wrappers and orange peel and</p>
<p>seaweed, folded over my foot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I heard the sand thud behind me, and Cal came up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Let's swim to that rock out there.'  I pointed at it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Are you crazy?  That's a mile out.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What are you?' I said.  'Chicken?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cal took me by the elbow and jostled me into the water.  When we were</p>
<p>waist high, he pushed me under.  I surfaced, splashing, my eyes seared</p>
<p>with salt.  Underneath, the water was green and semi-opaque as a hunk</p>
<p>of quartz.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I started to swim, a modified dogpaddle, keeping my face towards the</p>
<p>rock.  Cal did a slow crawl.  After a while he put his head up and</p>
<p>treaded water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Can't make it.'  He was panting heavily.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Okay.  You go back.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I would swim out until I was too tired to swim back.  As I</p>
<p>paddled on, my heartbeat boomed like a dull motor in my ears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am I am I am.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That morning I had tried to hang myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had taken the silk cord of my mother's yellow bathrobe as soon as she</p>
<p>left for work, and, in the amber shade of the bedroom, fashioned it</p>
<p>into a knot that slipped up and down on itself.  It took me a long time</p>
<p>to do this, because I was poor at knots and had no idea how to make a</p>
<p>proper one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I hunted around for a place to attach the rope.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The trouble was, our house had the wrong kind of ceilings.  The</p>
<p>ceilings were low, white and smoothly plastered, without a light</p>
<p>fixture or a wood beam in sight.  I thought with longing of the house</p>
<p>my grandmother had before she sold it to come and live with us, and</p>
<p>then with my Aunt Libby.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My grandmother's house was built in the fine, nineteenth-century style,</p>
<p>with lofty rooms and sturdy chandelier brackets and high closets with</p>
<p>stout rails across them, and an attic where nobody ever went, full of</p>
<p>trunks and parrot cages and dressmaker's dummies and overhead beams</p>
<p>thick as a ship's timbers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it was an old house, and she'd sold it, and I didn't know anybody</p>
<p>else with a house like that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a discouraging time of walking about with the silk cord dangling</p>
<p>from my neck like a yellow cat's tail and finding no place to fasten</p>
<p>it, I sat on the edge of my mother's bed and tried pulling the cord</p>
<p>tight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But each time I would get the cord so tight I could feel a rushing in</p>
<p>my ears and a flush of blood in my face, my hands would weaken and let</p>
<p>go, and I would be all right again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I saw that my body had all sorts of little tricks, such as making</p>
<p>my hands go limp at the crucial second, which would save it, time and</p>
<p>again, whereas if I had the whole say, I would be dead in a flash.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would simply have to ambush it with whatever sense I had left, or it</p>
<p>would trap me in its stupid cage for fifty years without any sense at</p>
<p>all.  And when people found out my mind had gone, as they would have</p>
<p>to, sooner or later, in spite of my mother's guarded tongue, they would</p>
<p>persuade her to put me into an asylum where I could be cured.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Only my case was incurable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had bought a few paperbacks on abnormal psychology at the drug store</p>
<p>and compared my symptoms with the symptoms in the books, and sure</p>
<p>enough, my symptoms tallied with the most hopeless cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only thing I could read, beside the scandal sheets, were these</p>
<p>abnormal psychology books.  It was as if some slim opening had been</p>
<p>left, so I could learn all I needed to know about my case to end it in</p>
<p>the proper way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wondered, after the hanging fiasco, if I shouldn't just give it up</p>
<p>and turn myself over to the doctors, but then I remembered Doctor</p>
<p>Gordon and his private shock machine.  Once I was locked up they could</p>
<p>use that on me all the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And I thought of how my mother and brother and friends would visit me,</p>
<p>day after day, hoping I would be better.  Then their visits would</p>
<p>slacken off, and they would give up hope.  They would grow old.  They</p>
<p>would forget me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They would be poor, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They would want me to have the best of care at first, so they would</p>
<p>sink all their money in a private hospital like Doctor Gordon's.</p>
<p>Finally, when the money was used up, I would be moved to a state</p>
<p>hospital, with hundreds of people like me, in a big cage in the</p>
<p>basement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The more hopeless you were, the further away they hid you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cal had turned around and was swimming in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I watched, he dragged himself slowly out of the neck-deep sea.</p>
<p>Against the khaki-coloured sand and the green shore wavelets, his body</p>
<p>was bisected for a moment, like a white worm.  Then it crawled</p>
<p>completely out of the green and on to the khaki and lost itself among</p>
<p>dozens and dozens of other worms that were wriggling or just lolling</p>
<p>about between the sea and the sky.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I paddled my hands in the water and kicked my feet.  The egg-shaped</p>
<p>rock didn't seem to be any nearer than it had been when Cal and I had</p>
<p>looked at it from the shore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I saw it would be pointless to swim as far as the rock, because my</p>
<p>body would take that excuse to climb out and lie in the sun, gathering</p>
<p>strength to swim back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only thing to do was to drown myself then and there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I stopped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I brought my hands to my breast, ducked my head, and dived, using my</p>
<p>hands to push the water aside.  The water pressed in on my eardrums and</p>
<p>on my heart.  I fanned myself down, but before I knew where I was, the</p>
<p>water had spat me up into the sun, and the world was sparkling all</p>
<p>about me like blue and green and yellow semi-precious stones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I dashed the water from my eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was panting, as after a strenuous exertion, but floating, without</p>
<p>effort.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I dived, and dived again, and each time popped up like a cork.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The grey rock mocked me, bobbing on the water easy as a lifebuoy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew when I was beaten.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I turned back.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The flowers nodded like bright, knowledgeable children as I trundled</p>
<p>them down the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt silly in my sage-green volunteer's uniform, and superfluous,</p>
<p>unlike the white-uniformed doctors and nurses, or even the</p>
<p>brown-uniformed scrubwomen with their mops and their buckets of grimy</p>
<p>water, who passed me without a word.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I had been getting paid, no matter how little, I could at least</p>
<p>count this a proper job, but all I got for a morning of pushing round</p>
<p>magazines and candy and flowers was a free lunch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother said the cure for thinking too much about yourself was</p>
<p>helping somebody who was worse off than you, so Teresa had arranged for</p>
<p>me to sign on as a volunteer at our local hospital.  It was difficult</p>
<p>to be a volunteer at this hospital, because that's what all the Junior</p>
<p>League women wanted to do, but luckily for me, a lot of them were away</p>
<p>on vacation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had hoped they would send me to a ward with some really gruesome</p>
<p>cases, who would see through my numb, dumb face to how I meant well,</p>
<p>and be grateful.  But the head of the volunteers, a society lady at our</p>
<p>church, took one look at me and said, 'You're on maternity.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I rode the elevator up three flights to the maternity ward and</p>
<p>reported to the head nurse.  She gave me the trolley of flowers.  I was</p>
<p>supposed to put the right vases at the right beds in the right rooms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But before I came to the door of the first room I noticed that a lot of</p>
<p>the flowers were droopy and brown at the edges.  I thought it would be</p>
<p>discouraging for a woman who'd just had a baby to see somebody plonk</p>
<p>down a big bouquet of dead flowers in front of her, so I steered the</p>
<p>trolley to a wash-basin in an alcove in the hall and began to pick out</p>
<p>all the flowers that were dead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I picked out all those that were dying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was no waste-basket in sight, so I crumpled the flowers up and</p>
<p>laid them in the deep white basin.  The basin felt cold as a tomb.  I</p>
<p>smiled.  This must be how they laid the bodies away in the hospital</p>
<p>morgue.  My gesture, in its small way, echoed the larger gesture of the</p>
<p>doctors and nurses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I swung the door of the first room open and walked in, dragging my</p>
<p>trolley.  A couple of nurses jumped up, and I had a confused impression</p>
<p>of shelves and medicine cabinets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you want?' one of the nurses demanded sternly.  I couldn't</p>
<p>tell one from the other, they all looked just alike.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm taking the flowers round.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse who had spoken put a hand on my shoulder and led me out of</p>
<p>the room, manoeuvring the trolley with her free, expert hand.  She</p>
<p>flung open the swinging doors of the room next to that one and bowed me</p>
<p>in.  Then she disappeared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could hear giggles in the distance till a door shut and cut them off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were six beds in the room, and each bed had a woman in it.  The</p>
<p>women were all sitting up and knitting or riffling through magazines or</p>
<p>putting their hair in pincurls and chattering like parrots in a parrot</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had thought they would be sleeping, or lying quiet and pale, so I</p>
<p>could tiptoe round without any trouble and match the bed numbers to the</p>
<p>numbers inked on adhesive tape on the vases, but before I had a chance</p>
<p>to get my bearings, a bright, jazzy blonde with a sharp, triangular</p>
<p>face beckoned to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I approached her, leaving the trolley in the middle of the floor, but</p>
<p>then she made an impatient gesture, and I saw she wanted me to bring</p>
<p>the trolley too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wheeled the trolley over to her bedside with a helpful smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hey, where's my larkspur?'  A large, flabby lady from across the ward</p>
<p>raked me with an eagle eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sharp-faced blonde bent over the trolley.  'Here are my yellow</p>
<p>roses,' she said, 'but they're all mixed up with some lousy iris.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other voices joined the voices of the first two women.  They sounded</p>
<p>cross and loud and full of complaint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was opening my mouth to explain that I had thrown a bunch of dead</p>
<p>larkspur in the sink, and that some of the vases I had weeded out</p>
<p>looked skimpy, there were so few flowers left, so I had joined a few of</p>
<p>the bouquets together to fill them out, when the swinging door flew</p>
<p>open and a nurse stalked in to see what the commotion was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Listen, nurse, I had this big bunch of larkspur Larry brought last</p>
<p>night.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She's loused up my yellow roses.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unbuttoning the green uniform as I ran, I stuffed it, in passing, into</p>
<p>the washbasin with the rubbish of dead flowers.  Then I took the</p>
<p>deserted side steps down to the street two at a time, without meeting</p>
<p>another soul.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Which way is the graveyard?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Italian in the black leather jacket stopped and pointed down an</p>
<p>alley behind the white Methodist church.  I remembered the Methodist</p>
<p>church.  I had been a Methodist for the first nine years of my life,</p>
<p>before my father died and we moved and turned Unitarian.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother had been a Catholic before she was a Methodist.  My</p>
<p>grandmother and my grandfather and my Aunt Libby were all still</p>
<p>Catholics.  My Aunt Libby had broken away from the Catholic Church at</p>
<p>the same time my mother did, but then she'd fallen in love with an</p>
<p>Italian Catholic, so she'd gone back again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lately I had considered going into the Catholic Church myself.  I knew</p>
<p>that Catholics thought killing yourself was an awful sin.  But perhaps,</p>
<p>if this was so, they might have a good way to persuade me out of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, I didn't believe in life after death or the virgin birth or</p>
<p>the Inquisition or the infallibility of that little monkey-faced Pope</p>
<p>or anything, but I didn't have to let the priest see this, I could just</p>
<p>concentrate on my sin, and he would help me repent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only trouble was, Church, even the Catholic Church, didn't take up</p>
<p>the whole of your life.  No matter how much you knelt and prayed, you</p>
<p>still had to eat three meals a day and have a job and live in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I might see how long you had to be a Catholic before you</p>
<p>became a nun, so I asked my mother, thinking she'd know the best way to</p>
<p>go about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother had laughed at me.  'Do you think they'll take somebody like</p>
<p>you, right off the bat?  Why you've got to know all these catechisms</p>
<p>and credos and believe in them, lock, stock and barrel.  A girl with</p>
<p>your sense!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, I imagined myself going to some Boston priest--it would have to</p>
<p>be Boston, because I didn't want any priest in my home town to know I'd</p>
<p>thought of killing myself.  Priests were terrible gossips.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would be in black, with my dead white face, and I would throw myself</p>
<p>at this priest's feet and say, 'O Father, help me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But that was before people had begun to look at me in a funny way, like</p>
<p>those nurses in the hospital.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was pretty sure the Catholics wouldn't take in any crazy nuns.  My</p>
<p>Aunt Libby's husband had made a joke once, about a nun that a nunnery</p>
<p>sent to Teresa for a check-up.  This nun kept hearing harp notes in her</p>
<p>ears and a voice saying over and over, 'Alleluia!'  Only she wasn't</p>
<p>sure, on being closely questioned, whether the voice was saying</p>
<p>Alleluia or Arizona.  The nun had been born in Arizona.  I think she</p>
<p>ended up in some asylum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tugged my black veil down to my chin and strode in through the</p>
<p>wrought-iron gates.  I thought it odd that in all the time my father</p>
<p>had been buried in this graveyard, none of us had ever visited him.  My</p>
<p>mother hadn't let us come to his funeral because we were only children</p>
<p>then, and he had died in hospital, so the graveyard and even his death,</p>
<p>had always seemed unreal to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a great yearning, lately, to pay my father back for all the years</p>
<p>of neglect, and start tending his grave.  I had always been my father's</p>
<p>favourite, and it seemed fitting I should take on a mourning my mother</p>
<p>had never bothered with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought that if my father hadn't died, he would have taught me all</p>
<p>about insects, which was his speciality at the university.  He would</p>
<p>also have taught me German and Greek and Latin, which he knew, and</p>
<p>perhaps I would be a Lutheran.  My father had been a Lutheran in</p>
<p>Wisconsin, but they were out of style in New England, so he had become</p>
<p>a lapsed Lutheran and then, my mother said, a bitter atheist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The graveyard disappointed me.  It lay at the outskirts of the town, on</p>
<p>low ground, like a rubbish dump, and as I walked up and down the gravel</p>
<p>paths, I could smell the stagnant salt marshes in the distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The old part of the graveyard was all right, with its worn, flat stones</p>
<p>and lichen-bitten monuments, but I soon saw my father must be buried in</p>
<p>the modern part with dates in the 1940's.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stones in the modern part were crude and cheap, and here and there</p>
<p>a grave was rimmed with marble, like an oblong bathtub full of dirt,</p>
<p>and rusty metal containers stuck up about where the person's navel</p>
<p>would be, full of plastic flowers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A fine drizzle started drifting down from the grey sky, and I grew very</p>
<p>depressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't find my father anywhere.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Low, shaggy clouds scudded over that part of the horizon where the sea</p>
<p>lay, behind the marshes and the beach shanty settlements, and raindrops</p>
<p>darkened the black mackintosh I had bought that morning.  A clammy</p>
<p>dampness sank through to my skin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had asked the salesgirl, 'Is it water-repellent?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And she had said, 'No raincoat is ever water-_repellent_.  It's</p>
<p>showerproofed.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And when I asked her what showerproofed was, she told me I had better</p>
<p>buy an umbrella.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I hadn't enough money for an umbrella.  What with bus fare in and</p>
<p>out of Boston and peanuts and newspapers and abnormal psychology books</p>
<p>and trips to my old home town by the sea, my New York fund was almost</p>
<p>exhausted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had decided that when there was no more money in my bank account I</p>
<p>would do it, and that morning I'd spent the last of it on the black</p>
<p>raincoat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I saw my father's gravestone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was crowded right up by another gravestone, head to head, the way</p>
<p>people are crowded in a charity ward when there isn't enough space.</p>
<p>The stone was of a molded pink marble, like tinned salmon, and all</p>
<p>there was on it was my father's name and, under it, two dates,</p>
<p>separated by a little dash.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the foot of the stone I arranged the rainy armful of azaleas I had</p>
<p>picked from a bush at the gateway of the graveyard.  Then my legs</p>
<p>folded under me, and I sat down in the sopping grass.  I couldn't</p>
<p>understand why I was crying so hard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I remembered that I had never cried for my father's death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother hadn't cried either.  She had just smiled and said what a</p>
<p>merciful thing it was for him he had died, because if he had lived he</p>
<p>would have been crippled and an invalid for life, and he couldn't have</p>
<p>stood that, he would rather have died than had that happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I laid my face to the smooth face of the marble and howled my loss into</p>
<p>the cold salt rain.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew just how to go about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The minute the car tyres crunched off down the drive and the sound of</p>
<p>the motor faded, I jumped out of bed and hurried into my white blouse</p>
<p>and green figured skirt and black raincoat.  The raincoat felt damp</p>
<p>still, from the day before, but that would soon cease to matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I went downstairs and picked up a pale blue envelope from the</p>
<p>dining-room table and scrawled on the back, in large, painstaking</p>
<p>letters: _I am going for a long walk_.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I propped the message where my mother would see it the minute she came</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I laughed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had forgotten the most important thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I ran upstairs and dragged a chair into my mother's closet.  Then I</p>
<p>climbed up and reached for the small green strongbox on the top shelf.</p>
<p>I could have torn the metal cover off with my bare hands, the lock was</p>
<p>so feeble, but I wanted to do things in a calm, orderly way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pulled out my mother's upper right-hand bureau drawer and slipped the</p>
<p>blue jewellery box from its hiding-place under the scented Irish linen</p>
<p>handkerchiefs.  I unpinned the little key from the dark velvet.  Then I</p>
<p>unlocked the strongbox and took out the bottle of new pills.  There</p>
<p>were more than I had hoped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were at least fifty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I had waited until my mother doled them out to me, night by night,</p>
<p>it would have taken me fifty nights to save up enough.  And in fifty</p>
<p>nights, college would have opened, and my brother would have come back</p>
<p>from Germany, and it would be too late.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pinned the key back in the jewellery box among the clutter of</p>
<p>inexpensive chains and rings, put the jewellery box back in the drawer</p>
<p>under the handkerchiefs, returned the strongbox to the closet shelf and</p>
<p>set the chair on the rug in the exact spot I had dragged it from.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I went downstairs and into the kitchen.  I turned on the tap and</p>
<p>poured myself a tall glass of water.  Then I took the glass of water</p>
<p>and the bottle of pills and went down into the cellar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A dim, undersea light filtered through the slits of the cellar windows.</p>
<p>Behind the oil burner, a dark gap showed in the wall at about shoulder</p>
<p>height and ran back under the breezeway, out of sight.  The breezeway</p>
<p>had been added to the house after the cellar was dug, and built out</p>
<p>over this secret, earth-bottomed crevice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A few old, rotting fireplace logs blocked the hole mouth.  I shoved</p>
<p>them back a bit.  Then I set the glass of water and the bottle of pills</p>
<p>side by side on the flat surface of one of the logs and started to</p>
<p>heave myself up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It took me a good while to heft my body into the gap, but at last,</p>
<p>after many tries, I managed it, and crouched at the mouth of the</p>
<p>darkness, like a troll.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The earth seemed friendly under my bare feet, but cold.  I wondered how</p>
<p>long it had been since this particular square of soil had seen the sun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, one after the other, I lugged the heavy, dust-covered logs across</p>
<p>the hole mouth.  The dark felt thick as velvet.  I reached for the</p>
<p>glass and bottle, and, carefully, on my knees, with bent head, crawled</p>
<p>to the farthest wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cobwebs touched my face with the softness of moths.  Wrapping my black</p>
<p>coat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills</p>
<p>and started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first nothing happened, but as I approached the bottom of the</p>
<p>bottle, red and blue lights began to flash before my eyes.  The bottle</p>
<p>slid from my fingers and I lay down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The silence drew off, baring the pebbles and shells and all the tatty</p>
<p>wreckage of my life.  Then, at the rim of vision, it gathered itself,</p>
<p>and in one sweeping tide, rushed me to sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-14">
<h2>Chapter Fourteen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>It was completely dark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt the darkness, but nothing else, and my head rose, feeling it,</p>
<p>like the head of a worm.  Someone was moaning.  Then a great, hard</p>
<p>weight smashed against my cheek like a stone wall and the moaning</p>
<p>stopped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The silence surged back, smoothing itself as black water smooths to its</p>
<p>old surface calm over a dropped stone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A cool wind rushed by.  I was being transported at enormous speed down</p>
<p>a tunnel into the earth.  Then the wind stopped.  There was a rumbling,</p>
<p>as of many voices, protesting and disagreeing in the distance.  Then</p>
<p>the voices stopped.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A chisel cracked down on my eye, and a slit of light opened, like a</p>
<p>mouth or a wound, till the darkness clamped shut on it again.  I tried</p>
<p>to roll away from the direction of the light, but hands wrapped round</p>
<p>my limbs like mummy bands, and I couldn't move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I began to think I must be in an underground chamber, lit by blinding</p>
<p>lights, and that the chamber was full of people who for some reason</p>
<p>were holding me down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the chisel struck again, and the light leapt into my head, and</p>
<p>through the thick, warm, furry dark, a voice cried,</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mother!'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Air breathed and played over my face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt the shape of a room around me, a big room with open windows.  A</p>
<p>pillow moulded itself under my head, and my body floated, without</p>
<p>pressure, between thin sheets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I felt warmth, like a hand on my face.  I must be lying in the</p>
<p>sun.  If I opened my eyes, I would see colours and shapes bending in</p>
<p>upon me like nurses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was completely dark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somebody was breathing beside me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't see,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A cheery voice spoke out of the dark.  'There are lots of blind people</p>
<p>in the world.  You'll marry a nice blind man some day.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The man with the chisel had come back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do you bother?' I said.  'It's no use.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You mustn't talk like that.'  His fingers probed at the great, aching</p>
<p>boss over my left eye.  Then he loosened something, and a ragged gap of</p>
<p>light appeared, like the hole in a wall.  A man's head peered round the</p>
<p>edge of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Can you see me?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Can you see anything else?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I remembered.  'I can't see anything.'  The gap narrowed and went</p>
<p>dark.  'I'm blind.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nonsense!  Who told you that?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The nurse.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The man snorted.  He finished taping the bandage back over my eye.</p>
<p>'You are a very lucky girl.  Your sight is perfectly intact.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Somebody to see you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse beamed and disappeared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother came smiling round the foot of the bed.  She was wearing a</p>
<p>dress with purple cartwheels on it and she looked awful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A big tall boy followed her.  At first I couldn't make out who it was,</p>
<p>because my eye only opened a short way, but then I saw it was my</p>
<p>brother.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They said you wanted to see me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother perched on the edge of the bed and laid a hand on my leg.</p>
<p>She looked loving and reproachful, and I wanted her to go away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I didn't think I said anything.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They said you called for me.'  She seemed ready to cry.  Her face</p>
<p>puckered up and quivered like a pale jelly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How are you?' my brother said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked my mother in the eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The same,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'You have a visitor.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't want a visitor.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse bustled out and whispered to somebody in the hall.  Then she</p>
<p>came back.  'He'd very much like to see you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked down at the yellow legs sticking out of the unfamiliar white</p>
<p>silk pyjamas they had dressed me in.  The skin shook flabbily when I</p>
<p>moved, as if there wasn't a muscle in it, and it was covered with a</p>
<p>short, thick stubble of black hair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who is it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Somebody you know.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What's his name?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'George Bakewell.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't know any George Bakewell.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He says he knows you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the nurse went out, and a very familiar boy came in and said,</p>
<p>'Mind if I sit on the edge of your bed?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was wearing a white coat, and I could see a stethoscope poking out</p>
<p>of his pocket.  I thought it must be somebody I knew dressed up as a</p>
<p>doctor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had meant to cover my legs if anybody came in, but now I saw it was</p>
<p>too late, so I let them stick out, just as they were, disgusting and</p>
<p>ugly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's me,' I thought.  'That's what I am.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You remember me, don't you, Esther?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I squinted at the boy's face through the crack of my good eye.  The</p>
<p>other eye hadn't opened yet, but the eye doctor said it would be all</p>
<p>right in a few days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The boy looked at me as if I were some exciting new zoo animal and he</p>
<p>was about to burst out laughing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You remember me, don't you, Esther?'  He spoke slowly, the way one</p>
<p>speaks to a dull child.  'I'm George Bakewell.  I go to your church.</p>
<p>You dated my room-mate once at Amherst.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought I placed the boy's face then.  It hovered dimly at the rim of</p>
<p>memory--the sort of face to which I would never bother to attach a name.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What are you doing here?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm houseman at this hospital.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>How could this George Bakewell have become a doctor so suddenly? I</p>
<p>wondered.  He didn't really know me, either.  He just wanted to see</p>
<p>what a girl who was crazy enough to kill herself looked like.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I turned my face to the wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Get out,' I said.  'Get the hell out and don't come back.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'I want to see a mirror.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse hummed busily as she opened one drawer after another,</p>
<p>stuffing the new underclothes and blouses and skirts and pyjamas my</p>
<p>mother had bought me into the black patent leather overnight case.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why can't I see a mirror?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had been dressed in a sheath, striped grey and white, like mattress</p>
<p>ticking, with a wide, shiny red belt, and they had propped me up in an</p>
<p>armchair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why can't I?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Because you better not.'  The nurse shut the lid of the overnight case</p>
<p>with a little snap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Because you don't look very pretty.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, just let me see.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse sighed and opened the top bureau drawer.  She took out a</p>
<p>large mirror in a wooden frame that matched the wood of the bureau and</p>
<p>handed it to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first I didn't see what the trouble was.  It wasn't a mirror at all,</p>
<p>but a picture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You couldn't tell whether the person in the picture was a man or a</p>
<p>woman, because their hair was shaved off and sprouted in bristly</p>
<p>chicken-feather tufts all over their head.  One side of the person's</p>
<p>face was purple, and bulged out in a shapeless way, shading to green</p>
<p>along the edges, and then to a sallow yellow.  The person's mouth was</p>
<p>pale brown, with a rose-coloured sore at either corner.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most startling thing about the face was its supernatural</p>
<p>conglomeration of bright colours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mouth in the mirror cracked into a grin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A minute after the crash another nurse ran in.  She took one look at</p>
<p>the broken mirror, and at me, standing over the blind, white pieces,</p>
<p>and hustled the young nurse out of the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Didn't I _tell_ you,' I could hear her say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But I only...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Didn't I _tell_ you!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I listened with mild interest.  Anybody could drop a mirror.  I didn't</p>
<p>see why they should get so stirred up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other, older nurse came back into the room.  She stood there, arms</p>
<p>folded, staring hard at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Seven years' bad luck.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I said,' the nurse raised her voice, as if speaking to a deaf person,</p>
<p>'_seven years' bad luck_.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The young nurse returned with a dustpan and brush and began to sweep up</p>
<p>the glittery splinters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's only a superstition,' I said then.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Huh!'  The second nurse addressed herself to the nurse on her hands</p>
<p>and knees as if I wasn't there.  'At you-know-where they'll take care</p>
<p>of _her_!'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>From the back window of the ambulance I could see street after familiar</p>
<p>street funnelling off into a summery green distance.  My mother sat on</p>
<p>one side of me, and my brother on the other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had pretended I didn't know why they were moving me from the hospital</p>
<p>in my home town to a city hospital, to see what they would say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'They want you to be in a special ward,' my mother said.  'They don't</p>
<p>have that sort of ward at our hospital.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I liked it where I was.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother's mouth tightened.  'You should have behaved better, then.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You shouldn't have broken that mirror.  Then maybe they'd have let you</p>
<p>stay.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But of course I knew the mirror had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat in bed with the covers up to my neck.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why can't I get up?  I'm not sick.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ward rounds,' the nurse said.  'You can get up after ward rounds.'</p>
<p>She shoved the bed-curtains back and revealed a fat young Italian woman</p>
<p>in the next bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Italian woman had a mass of tight black curls, starting at her</p>
<p>forehead, that rose in a mountainous pompadour and cascaded down her</p>
<p>back.  Whenever she moved, the huge arrangement of hair moved with her,</p>
<p>as if made of stiff black paper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman looked at me and giggled.  'Why are you here?'  She didn't</p>
<p>wait for an answer.  'I'm here on account of my French-Canadian</p>
<p>mother-in-law.'  She giggled again.  'My husband knows I can't stand</p>
<p>her, and still he said she could come and visit us, and when she came,</p>
<p>my tongue stuck out of my head, I couldn't stop it.  They ran me into</p>
<p>Emergency and then they put me up here,' she lowered her voice, 'along</p>
<p>with the nuts.'  Then she said, 'What's the matter with you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I turned her my full face, with the bulging purple and green eye.  'I</p>
<p>tried to kill myself.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman stared at me.  Then, hastily, she snatched up a movie</p>
<p>magazine from her bed-table and pretended to be reading.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The swinging door opposite my bed flew open, and a whole troop of young</p>
<p>boys and girls in white coats came in, with an older, grey-haired man.</p>
<p>They were all smiling with bright, artificial smiles.  They grouped</p>
<p>themselves at the foot of my bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And how are you feeling this morning, Miss Greenwood?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to decide which one of them had spoken.  I hate saying anything</p>
<p>to a group of people.  When I talk to a group of people I always have</p>
<p>to single out one and talk to him, and all the while I am talking I</p>
<p>feel the others are peering at me and taking unfair advantage.  I also</p>
<p>hate people to ask cheerfully how you are when they know you're feeling</p>
<p>like hell and expect you to say 'Fine'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I feel lousy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Lousy.  Hmm,' somebody said, and a boy ducked his head with a little</p>
<p>smile.  Somebody else scribbled something on a clipboard.  Then</p>
<p>somebody pulled a straight, solemn face and said, 'And why do you feel</p>
<p>lousy?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought some of the boys and girls in that bright group might well be</p>
<p>friends of Buddy Willard.  They would know I knew him, and they would</p>
<p>be curious to see me, and afterwards they would gossip about me among</p>
<p>themselves.  I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't sleep...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>They interrupted me.  'But the nurse says you slept last night.'  I</p>
<p>looked round the crescent of fresh, strange faces.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I can't read.'  I raised my voice.  'I can't eat.'  It occurred to me</p>
<p>I'd been eating ravenously ever since I came to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The people in the group had turned from me and were murmuring in low</p>
<p>voices to each other.  Finally, the grey-haired man stepped out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Thank you, Miss Greenwood.  You will be seen by one of the staff</p>
<p>doctors presently.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the group moved on to the bed of the Italian woman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And how are you feeling today, Mrs...' somebody said, and the name</p>
<p>sounded long and full of l's, like Mrs Tomolillo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Tomolillo giggled.  'Oh, I'm fine, doctor.  I'm just fine.'  Then</p>
<p>she lowered her voice and whispered something I couldn't hear.  One or</p>
<p>two people in the group glanced in my direction.  Then somebody said,</p>
<p>'All right, Mrs Tomolillo,' and somebody stepped out and pulled the</p>
<p>bed-curtain between us like a white wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat on one end of a wooden bench in the grassy square between the</p>
<p>four brick walls of the hospital.  My mother, in her purple cartwheel</p>
<p>dress, sat at the other end.  She had her head propped in her hand,</p>
<p>index finger on her cheek, and thumb under her chin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Tomolillo was sitting with some dark-haired, laughing Italians on</p>
<p>the next bench down.  Every time my mother moved, Mrs Tomolillo</p>
<p>imitated her.  Now Mrs Tomolillo was sitting with her index finger on</p>
<p>her cheek and her thumb under her chin, and her head tilted wistfully</p>
<p>to one side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't move,' I told my mother in a low voice.  'That woman's imitating</p>
<p>you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother turned to glance round, but quick as a wink, Mrs Tomolillo</p>
<p>dropped her fat white hands in her lap and started talking vigorously</p>
<p>to her friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why no, she's not,' my mother said.  'She's not even paying any</p>
<p>attention to us.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the minute my mother turned round to me again, Mrs Tomolillo</p>
<p>matched the tips of her fingers together the way my mother had just</p>
<p>done and cast a black, mocking look at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The lawn was white with doctors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the time my mother and I had been sitting there, in the narrow cone</p>
<p>of sun that shone down between the tall brick walls, doctors had been</p>
<p>coming up to me and introducing themselves.  'I'm Doctor Soandso, I'm</p>
<p>Doctor Soandso.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of them looked so young I knew they couldn't be proper doctors,</p>
<p>and one of them had a queer name that sounded just like Doctor</p>
<p>Syphilis, so I began to look out for suspicious, fake names, and sure</p>
<p>enough, a dark-haired fellow who looked very like Doctor Gordon, except</p>
<p>that he had black skin where Doctor Gordon's skin was white, came up</p>
<p>and said, 'I'm Doctor Pancreas,' and shook my hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After introducing themselves, the doctors all stood within listening</p>
<p>distance, only I couldn't tell my mother that they were taking down</p>
<p>every word we said without their hearing me, so I leaned over and</p>
<p>whispered into her ear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother drew back sharply.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, Esther, I wish you would co-operate.  They say you don't</p>
<p>co-operate.  They say you won't talk to any of the doctors or make</p>
<p>anything in Occupational Therapy...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've got to get out of here,' I told her meaningly.  'Then I'd be all</p>
<p>right.  You got me in here,' I said.  'You get me out.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought if only I could persuade my mother to get me out of the</p>
<p>hospital I could work on her sympathies, like that boy with brain</p>
<p>disease in the play, and convince her what was the best thing to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To my surprise, my mother said, 'All right, I'll try to get you</p>
<p>out--even if only to a better place.  If I try to get you out,' she</p>
<p>laid a hand on my knee, 'promise you'll be good?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I spun round and glared straight at Doctor Syphilis, who stood at my</p>
<p>elbow taking notes on a tiny, almost invisible pad.  'I promise,' I</p>
<p>said in a loud, conspicuous voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The negro wheeled the food cart into the patients' dining-room.  The</p>
<p>Psychiatric Ward at the hospital was very small--just two corridors in</p>
<p>an L-shape, lined with rooms, and an alcove of beds behind the OT shop,</p>
<p>where I was, and a little area with a table and a few seats by a window</p>
<p>in the corner of the L, which was our lounge and dining-room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Usually it was a shrunken old white man that brought our food, but</p>
<p>today it was a negro.  The negro was with a woman in blue stiletto</p>
<p>heels, and she was telling him what to do.  The negro kept grinning and</p>
<p>chuckling in a silly way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then he carried a tray over to our table with three lidded tin tureens</p>
<p>on it, and started banging the tureens down.  The woman left the room,</p>
<p>locking the door behind her.  All the time the negro was banging down</p>
<p>the tureens and then the dinted silver and the thick, white china</p>
<p>plates, he gawped at us with big, rolling eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could tell we were his first crazy people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nobody at the table made a move to take the lids off the tin tureens,</p>
<p>and the nurse stood back to see if any of us would take the lids off</p>
<p>before she came to do it.  Usually Mrs Tomolillo had taken the lids off</p>
<p>and dished out everybody's food like a little mother, but then they</p>
<p>sent her home, and nobody seemed to want to take her place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was starving, so I lifted the lid off the first bowl.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's very nice of you, Esther,' the nurse said pleasantly.  'Would</p>
<p>you like to take some beans and pass them round to the others?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I dished myself out a helping of green string beans and turned to pass</p>
<p>the tureen to the enormous red-headed woman at my right.  This was the</p>
<p>first time the red-headed woman had been allowed up to the table.  I</p>
<p>had seen her once, at the very end of the L-shaped corridor, standing</p>
<p>in front of an open door with bars on the square, inset window.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She had been yelling and laughing in a rude way and slapping her thighs</p>
<p>at the passing doctors, and the white-jacketed attendant who took care</p>
<p>of the people in that end of the ward was leaning against the hall</p>
<p>radiator, laughing himself sick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The red-headed woman snatched the tureen from me and upended it on her</p>
<p>plate.  Beans mountained up in front of her and scattered over on to</p>
<p>her lap and on to the floor like stiff, green straws.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, Mrs Mole!' the nurse said in a sad voice.  'I think you better eat</p>
<p>in your room today.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And she returned most of the beans to the tureen and gave it to the</p>
<p>person next to Mrs Mole and led Mrs Mole off.  All the way down the</p>
<p>hall to her room, Mrs Mole kept turning round and making leering faces</p>
<p>at us, and ugly, oinking noises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The negro had come back and was starting to collect the empty plates of</p>
<p>people who hadn't dished out any beans yet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'We're not done,' I told him.  'You can just wait.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mah, mah!'  The negro widened his eyes in mock wonder.  He glanced</p>
<p>round.  The nurse had not yet returned from locking up Mrs Mole.  The</p>
<p>negro made me an insolent bow.  'Miss Mucky-Muck,' he said under his</p>
<p>breath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lifted the lid off the second tureen and uncovered a wodge of</p>
<p>macaroni, stone-cold and stuck together in a gluey paste.  The third</p>
<p>and last tureen was chock-full of baked beans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I knew perfectly well you didn't serve two kinds of beans together</p>
<p>at a meal.  Beans and carrots, or beans and peas, maybe, but never</p>
<p>beans and beans.  The negro was just trying to see how much we would</p>
<p>take.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse came back, and the negro edged off at a distance.  I ate as</p>
<p>much as I could of the baked beans.  Then I rose from the table,</p>
<p>passing round to the side where the nurse couldn't see me below the</p>
<p>waist, and behind the negro, who was clearing the dirty plates.  I drew</p>
<p>my foot back and gave him a sharp, hard kick on the calf of the leg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The negro leapt away with a yelp and rolled his eyes at me.  'Oh Miz,</p>
<p>oh Miz,' he moaned, rubbing his leg.  'You shouldn't of done that, you</p>
<p>shouldn't, you reely shouldn't.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's what _you_ get,' I said, and stared him in the eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't you want to get up today?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.'  I huddled down more deeply in the bed and pulled the sheet up</p>
<p>over my head.  Then I lifted a corner of the sheet and peered out.  The</p>
<p>nurse was shaking down the thermometer she had just removed from my</p>
<p>mouth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You see, it's normal.'  I had looked at the thermometer before she</p>
<p>came to collect it, the way I always did.  'You see, it's normal, what</p>
<p>do you keep taking it for?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wanted to tell her that if only something were wrong with my body it</p>
<p>would be fine, I would rather have anything wrong with my body than</p>
<p>something wrong with my head, but the idea seemed so involved and</p>
<p>wearisome that I didn't say anything.  I only burrowed down further in</p>
<p>the bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, through the sheet, I felt a slight, annoying pressure on my leg.</p>
<p>I peeped out.  The nurse had set her tray of thermometers on my bed</p>
<p>while she turned her back and took the pulse of the person who lay next</p>
<p>to me, in Mrs Tomolillo's place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A heavy naughtiness pricked through my veins, irritating and attractive</p>
<p>as the hurt of a loose tooth.  I yawned and stirred, as if about to</p>
<p>turn over, and edged my foot under the box.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh!'  The nurse's cry sounded like a cry for help, and another nurse</p>
<p>came running.  'Look what you've done!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I poked my head out of the covers and stared over the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>Around the overturned enamel tray, a star of thermometer shards</p>
<p>glittered, and balls of mercury trembled like celestial dew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm sorry,' I said.  'It was an accident.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second nurse fixed me with a baleful eye.  'You did it on purpose.</p>
<p>I _saw_ you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then she hurried off, and almost immediately two attendants came and</p>
<p>wheeled me, bed and all, down to Mrs Mole's old room, but not before I</p>
<p>had scooped up a ball of mercury.  Soon after they had locked the door,</p>
<p>I could see the negro's face, a molasses-coloured moon, risen at the</p>
<p>window grating, but I pretended not to notice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I opened my fingers a crack, like a child with a secret, and smiled at</p>
<p>the silver globe cupped in my palm.  If I dropped it, it would break</p>
<p>into a million little replicas of itself, and if I pushed them near</p>
<p>each other, they would fuse, without a crack, into one whole again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I smiled and smiled at the small silver ball.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't imagine what they had done with Mrs Mole.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-15">
<h2>Chapter Fifteen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Philomena Guinea's black Cadillac eased through the tight, five o'clock</p>
<p>traffic like a ceremonial car.  Soon it would cross one of the brief</p>
<p>bridges that arched the Charles, and I would, without thinking, open</p>
<p>the door and plunge out through the stream of traffic to the rail of</p>
<p>the bridge.  One jump, and the water would be over my head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Idly I twisted a kleenex to small, pill-sized pellets between my</p>
<p>fingers and watched my chance.  I sat in the middle of the back seat of</p>
<p>the Cadillac, my mother on one side of me, and my brother on the other,</p>
<p>both leaning slightly forward, like diagonal bars, one across each car</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In front of me I could see the spam-coloured expanse of the chauffeur's</p>
<p>neck, sandwiched between a blue cap and the shoulders of a bluejacket</p>
<p>and, next to him, like a frail, exotic bird, the silver hair and</p>
<p>emerald-feathered hat of Philomena Guinea, the famous novelist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wasn't quite sure why Mrs Guinea had turned up.  All I knew was that</p>
<p>she had interested herself in my case and that at one time, at the peak</p>
<p>of her career, she had been in an asylum as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother said that Mrs Guinea had sent her a telegram from the</p>
<p>Bahamas, where she read about me in a Boston paper.  Mrs Guinea had</p>
<p>telegrammed, 'Is there a boy in the case?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>If there was a boy in the case, Mrs Guinea couldn't, of course, have</p>
<p>anything to do with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But my mother had telegrammed back, 'No, it is Esther's writing.  She</p>
<p>thinks she will never write again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>So Mrs Guinea had flown back to Boston and taken me out of the cramped</p>
<p>city hospital ward, and now she was driving me to a private hospital</p>
<p>that had grounds and golf courses and gardens, like a country club,</p>
<p>where she would pay for me, as if I had a scholarship, until the</p>
<p>doctors she knew of there had made me well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother told me I should be grateful.  She said I had used up almost</p>
<p>all her money, and if it weren't for Mrs Guinea she didn't know where</p>
<p>I'd be.  I knew where I'd be, though.  I'd be in the big state hospital</p>
<p>in the country, cheek by jowl to this private place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew I should be grateful to Mrs Guinea, only I couldn't feel a</p>
<p>thing.  If Mrs Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a</p>
<p>round-the-world cruise, it wouldn't have made one scrap of difference</p>
<p>to me, because wherever I sat--on the deck of a ship or at a street</p>
<p>cafe in Paris or Bangkok--I would be sitting under the same glass bell</p>
<p>jar, stewing in my own sour air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blue sky opened its dome above the river, and the river was dotted with</p>
<p>sails.  I readied myself, but immediately my mother and my brother each</p>
<p>laid one hand on a door handle.  The tyres hummed briefly over the</p>
<p>grill of the bridge.  Water, sails, blue sky and suspended gulls</p>
<p>flashed by like an improbable postcard, and we were across.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sank back in the grey, plush seat and closed my eyes.  The air of the</p>
<p>bell jar wadded round me and I couldn't stir.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had my own room again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It reminded me of the room in Doctor Gordon's hospital--a bed, a</p>
<p>bureau, a closet, a table and chair.  A window with a screen, but no</p>
<p>bars.  My room was on the first floor, and the window, a short distance</p>
<p>above the pine-needle-padded ground, overlooked a wooded yard ringed by</p>
<p>a red brick wall.  If I jumped I wouldn't even bruise my knees.  The</p>
<p>inner surface of the tall wall seemed smooth as glass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The journey over the bridge had unnerved me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had missed a perfectly good chance.  The river water passed me by</p>
<p>like an untouched drink.  I suspected that even if my mother and</p>
<p>brother had not been there I would have made no move to jump.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I enrolled in the main building of the hospital, a slim young</p>
<p>woman had come up and introduced herself.  'My name is Doctor Nolan.  I</p>
<p>am to be Esther's doctor.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was surprised to have a woman.  I didn't think they had woman</p>
<p>psychiatrists.  This woman was a cross between Myrna Loy and my mother.</p>
<p>She wore a white blouse and a full skirt gathered at the waist by a</p>
<p>wide leather belt, and stylish, crescent-shaped spectacles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But after a nurse had led me across the lawn to the gloomy brick</p>
<p>building called Caplan, where I would live, Doctor Nolan didn't come to</p>
<p>see me, a whole lot of strange men came instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lay on my bed under the thick white blanket, and they entered my</p>
<p>room, one by one, and introduced themselves.  I couldn't understand why</p>
<p>there should be so many of them, or why they would want to introduce</p>
<p>themselves, and I began to think they were testing me, to see if I</p>
<p>noticed there were too many of them, and I grew wary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, a handsome, white-haired doctor came in and said he was the</p>
<p>director of the hospital.  Then he started talking about the Pilgrims</p>
<p>and Indians and who had the land after them, and what rivers ran</p>
<p>nearby, and who had built the first hospital, and how it had burned</p>
<p>down, and who had built the next hospital, until I thought he must be</p>
<p>waiting to see when I would interrupt him and tell him I knew all that</p>
<p>about rivers and Pilgrims was a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But then I thought some of it might be true, so I tried to sort out</p>
<p>what was likely to be true and what wasn't, only before I could do</p>
<p>that, he had said good-bye.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I waited till I heard the voices of all the doctors die away.  Then I</p>
<p>threw back the white blanket and put on my shoes and walked out into</p>
<p>the hall.  Nobody stopped me, so I walked round the corner of my wing</p>
<p>of the hall and down another, longer hall, past an open dining room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A maid in a green uniform was setting the tables for supper.  There</p>
<p>were white linen table-cloths and glasses and paper napkins.  I stored</p>
<p>the fact that there were real glasses in the corner of my mind the way</p>
<p>a squirrel stores a nut.  At the city hospital we had drunk out of</p>
<p>paper cups and had no knives to cut our meat.  The meat had always been</p>
<p>so overcooked we could cut it with a fork.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally I arrived at a big lounge with shabby furniture and a</p>
<p>threadbare rug.  A girl with a round pasty face and short black hair</p>
<p>was sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine.  She reminded me of a</p>
<p>Girl Scout leader I'd had once.  I glanced at her feet, and sure</p>
<p>enough, she wore those flat brown leather shoes with fringed tongues</p>
<p>lapping down over the front that are supposed to be so sporty, and the</p>
<p>ends of the laces were knobbed with little imitation acorns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The girl raised her eyes and smiled.  'I'm Valerie.  Who are you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pretended I hadn't heard and walked out of the lounge to the end of</p>
<p>the next wing.  On the way, I passed a waist-high door behind which I</p>
<p>saw some nurses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where is everybody?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Out.'  The nurse was writing something over and over on little pieces</p>
<p>of adhesive tape.  I leaned across the gate of the door to see what she</p>
<p>was writing, and it was E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood, E.</p>
<p>Greenwood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Out where?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, OT, the golf course, playing badminton.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I noticed a pile of clothes on a chair beside the nurse.  They were the</p>
<p>same clothes the nurse in the first hospital had been packing into the</p>
<p>patent leather case when I broke the mirror.  The nurse began sticking</p>
<p>the labels on to the clothes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I walked back to the lounge.  I couldn't understand what these people</p>
<p>were doing, playing badminton and golf.  They mustn't be really sick at</p>
<p>all, to do that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat down near Valerie and observed her carefully.  Yes, I thought,</p>
<p>she might just as well be in a Girl Scout camp.  She was reading her</p>
<p>tatty copy of _Vogue_ with intense interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What the hell is she doing here,' I wondered.  'There's nothing the</p>
<p>matter with her.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you mind if I smoke?'  Doctor Nolan leaned back in the armchair</p>
<p>next to my bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I said no, I liked the smell of smoke.  I thought if Doctor Nolan</p>
<p>smoked, she might stay longer.  This was the first time she had come to</p>
<p>talk with me.  When she left I would simply lapse into the old</p>
<p>blankness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Tell me about Doctor Gordon,' Doctor Nolan said suddenly.  'Did you</p>
<p>like him?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I gave Doctor Nolan a wary look.  I thought the doctors must all be in</p>
<p>it together, and that somewhere in this hospital, in a hidden corner,</p>
<p>there reposed a machine exactly like Doctor Gordon's, ready to jolt me</p>
<p>out of my skin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' I said.  'I didn't like him at all.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's interesting.  Why?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I didn't like what he did to me,'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Did to you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I told Doctor Nolan about the machine, and the blue flashes, and the</p>
<p>jolting and the noise.  While I was telling her she went very still.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That was a mistake,' she said then.  'It's not supposed to be like</p>
<p>that.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared at her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'If it's done properly,' Doctor Nolan said, 'it's like going to sleep.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'If anyone does that to me again I'll kill myself.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan said firmly, 'You won't have any shock treatments here.</p>
<p>Or if you do,' she amended, 'I'll tell you about it beforehand, and I</p>
<p>promise you it won't be anything like what you had before.  Why,' she</p>
<p>finished, 'some people even like them.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>After Doctor Nolan had gone I found a box of matches on the</p>
<p>window-sill.  It wasn't an ordinary-size box, but an extremely tiny</p>
<p>box.  I opened it and exposed a row of little white sticks with pinks</p>
<p>tips.  I tried to light one, and it crumpled in my hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't think why Doctor Nolan would have left me such a stupid</p>
<p>thing.  Perhaps she wanted to see if I would give it back.  Carefully I</p>
<p>stored the toy matches in the hem of my new wool bathrobe.  If Doctor</p>
<p>Nolan asked me for the matches, I would say I'd thought they were made</p>
<p>of candy and had eaten them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A new woman had moved into the room next to mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought she must be the only person in the building who was newer</p>
<p>than I was, so she wouldn't know how really bad I was, the way the rest</p>
<p>did.  I thought I might go in and make friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman was lying on her bed in a purple dress that fastened at the</p>
<p>neck with a cameo brooch and reached midway between her knees and her</p>
<p>shoes.  She had rusty hair knotted in a schoolmarmish bun, and thin,</p>
<p>silver-rimmed spectacles attached to her breast pocket with a black</p>
<p>elastic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello,' I said conversationally, sitting down on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>'My name's Esther, what's your name?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman didn't stir, she just stared up at the ceiling.  I felt hurt.</p>
<p>I thought maybe Valerie or somebody had told her when she first came in</p>
<p>how stupid I was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A nurse popped her head in at the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, there you are,' she said to me.  'Visiting Miss Norris.  How</p>
<p>nice!'  And she disappeared again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't know how long I sat there, watching the woman in purple and</p>
<p>wondering if her pursed, pink lips would open, and if they did open,</p>
<p>what they would say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, without speaking or looking at me, Miss Norris swung her feet</p>
<p>in their high, black, buttoned boots over the other side of the bed and</p>
<p>walked out of the room.  I thought she might be trying to get rid of me</p>
<p>in a subtle way.  Quietly, at a little distance, I followed her down</p>
<p>the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Miss Norris reached the door of the dining-room and paused.  All the</p>
<p>way to the dining-room she had walked precisely, placing her feet in</p>
<p>the very centre of the cabbage roses that twined through the pattern of</p>
<p>the carpet.  She waited a moment and then, one by one, lifted her feet</p>
<p>over the door-sill and into the dining-room as though stepping over an</p>
<p>invisible shin-high stile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She sat down at one of the round, linen-covered tables and unfolded a</p>
<p>napkin in her lap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's not supper for an hour yet,' the cook called out of the kitchen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Miss Norris didn't answer.  She just stared straight ahead of her</p>
<p>in a polite way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pulled up a chair opposite her at the table and unfolded a napkin.</p>
<p>We didn't speak, but sat there, in a close, sisterly silence, until the</p>
<p>gong for supper sounded down the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Lie down,' the nurse said.  'I'm going to give you another injection.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I rolled over on my stomach on the bed and hitched up my skirt.  Then I</p>
<p>pulled down the trousers of my silk pyjamas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My word, what all have you got under there?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Pyjamas.  So I won't have to bother getting in and out of them all the</p>
<p>time.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse made a little clucking noise.  Then she said, 'Which side?'</p>
<p>It was an old joke.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I raised my head and glanced back at my bare buttocks.  They were</p>
<p>bruised purple and green and blue from past injections.  The left side</p>
<p>looked darker than the right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You name it.'  The nurse jabbed the needle in, and I winced, savouring</p>
<p>the tiny hurt.  Three times each day the nurses injected me, and about</p>
<p>an hour after each injection they gave me a cup of sugary fruit juice</p>
<p>and stood by, watching me drink it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Lucky you,' Valerie said.  'You're on insulin.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nothing happens.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, it will.  I've had it.  Tell me when you get a reaction.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I never seemed to get any reaction.  I just grew fatter and fatter.</p>
<p>Already I filled the new, too-big clothes my mother had bought, and</p>
<p>when I peered down at my plump stomach and my broad hips I thought it</p>
<p>was a good thing Mrs Guinea hadn't seen me like this, because I looked</p>
<p>just as if I were going to have a baby.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Have you seen my scars?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Valerie pushed aside her black bang and indicated two pale marks, one</p>
<p>on either side of her forehead, as if at some time she had started to</p>
<p>sprout horns, but cut them off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were walking, just the two of us, with the Sports Therapist in the</p>
<p>asylum gardens.  Nowadays I was let out on walk privileges more and</p>
<p>more often.  They never let Miss Norris out at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Valerie said Miss Norris shouldn't be in Caplan, but in a building for</p>
<p>worse people called Wymark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you know what these scars are?' Valerie persisted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.  What are they?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've had a lobotomy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at Valerie in awe, appreciating for the first time her</p>
<p>perpetual marble calm.  'How do you feel?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Fine.  I'm not angry any more.  Before, I was always angry.  I was in</p>
<p>Wymark, before, and now I'm in Caplan.  I can go to town, now, or</p>
<p>shopping or to a movie, along with a nurse.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What will you do when you get out?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I'm not leaving,' Valerie laughed.  'I like it here.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Moving day!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why should I be moving?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse went on blithely opening and shutting my drawers, emptying</p>
<p>the closet and folding my belongings into the black overnight case.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought they must at last be moving me to Wymark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, you're only moving to the front of the house,' the nurse said</p>
<p>cheerfully.  'You'll like it.  There's lots more sun.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we came out into the hall, I saw that Miss Norris was moving too.</p>
<p>A nurse, young and cheerful as my own, stood in the doorway of Miss</p>
<p>Norris's room, helping Miss Norris into a purple coat with a scrawny</p>
<p>squirrel-fur collar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hour after hour I had been keeping watch by Miss Norris's bedside,</p>
<p>refusing the diversion of OT and walks and badminton matches and even</p>
<p>the weekly movies, which I enjoyed, and which Miss Norris never went</p>
<p>to, simply to brood over the pale, speechless circlet of her lips.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought how exciting it would be if she opened her mouth and spoke,</p>
<p>and I rushed out into the hall and announced this to the nurses.  They</p>
<p>would praise me for encouraging Miss Norris, and I would probably be</p>
<p>allowed shopping privileges and movie privileges downtown, and my</p>
<p>escape would be assured.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But in all my hours of vigil Miss Norris hadn't said a word.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where are you moving to?' I asked her now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse touched Miss Norris's elbow, and Miss Norris jerked into</p>
<p>motion like a doll on wheels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She's going to Wymark,' my nurse told me in a low voice.  'I'm afraid</p>
<p>Miss Norris isn't moving up like you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I watched Miss Norris lift one foot, and then the other, over the</p>
<p>invisible stile that barred the front doorsill.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've a surprise for you,' the nurse said as she installed me in a</p>
<p>sunny room in the front wing overlooking the green golf links.</p>
<p>'Somebody you know's just come today.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Somebody I know?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse laughed.  'Don't look at me like that.  It's not a</p>
<p>policeman.'  Then, as I didn't say anything, she added, 'She says she's</p>
<p>an old friend of yours.  She lives next door.  Why don't you pay her a</p>
<p>visit?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought the nurse must be joking, and that if I knocked on the door</p>
<p>next to mine I would hear no answer, but go in and find Miss Norris,</p>
<p>buttoned into her purple, squirrel-collared coat and lying on the bed,</p>
<p>her mouth blooming out of the quiet vase of her body like the bud of a</p>
<p>rose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, I went out and knocked on the neighbouring door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Come in!' called a gay voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I opened the door a crack and peered into the room.  The big, horsey</p>
<p>girl in jodhpurs sitting by the window glanced up with a broad smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Esther!'  She sounded out of breath, as if she had been running a</p>
<p>long, long distance and only just come to a halt.  'How nice to see</p>
<p>you.  They told me you were here.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Joan?' I said tentatively, then 'Joan!' in confusion and disbelief.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan beamed, revealing her large, gleaming, unmistakable teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's really me.  I thought you'd be surprised.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Chapter Sixteen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Joan's room, with its closet and bureau and table and chair and white</p>
<p>blanket with the big blue C on it, was a mirror image of my own.  It</p>
<p>occurred to me that Joan, hearing where I was, had engaged a room at</p>
<p>the asylum on pretence, simply as a joke.  That would explain why she</p>
<p>had told the nurse I was her friend.  I had never known Joan, except at</p>
<p>a cool distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How did you get here?'  I curled up on Joan's bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I read about you,' Joan said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I read about you, and I ran away.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How do you mean?' I said evenly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well,' Joan leaned back in the chintz-flowered asylum armchair, 'I had</p>
<p>a summer job working for the chapter head of some fraternity, like the</p>
<p>Masons, you know, but not the Masons, and I felt terrible.  I had these</p>
<p>bunions, I could hardly walk--in the last days I had to wear rubber</p>
<p>boots to work, instead of shoes, and you can imagine what _that_ did to</p>
<p>my morale...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought either Joan must be crazy--wearing rubber boots to work, or</p>
<p>she must be trying to see how crazy I was--believing all that.</p>
<p>Besides, only old people ever got bunions.  I decided to pretend I</p>
<p>thought she was crazy, and that I was only humouring her along.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I always feel lousy without shoes,' I said with an ambiguous smile.</p>
<p>'Did your feet hurt much?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Terribly.  And my boss--he'd just separated from his wife, he couldn't</p>
<p>come right out and get a divorce, because that wouldn't go with this</p>
<p>fraternal order--my boss kept buzzing me in every other minute, and</p>
<p>each time I moved, my feet hurt like the devil, but the second I'd sit</p>
<p>down at my desk again, buzz went the buzzer, and he'd have something</p>
<p>else he wanted to get off his chest...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why didn't you quit?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I did quit, more or less.  I stayed off work on sick leave.  I</p>
<p>didn't go out.  I didn't see anyone.  I stowed the telephone in a</p>
<p>drawer and never answered it...</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital.  I had</p>
<p>an appointment for twelve o'clock, and I was in an awful state.</p>
<p>Finally, at half past twelve, the receptionist came out and told me the</p>
<p>doctor had gone to lunch.  She asked me if I wanted to wait, and I said</p>
<p>yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Did he come back?'   The story sounded rather involved for Joan to</p>
<p>have made up out of whole cloth, but I led her on, to see what would</p>
<p>come of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh yes.  I was going to kill myself, mind you.  I said "If this doctor</p>
<p>doesn't do the trick, that's the end."  Well, the receptionist led me</p>
<p>down a long hall, and just as we got to the door she turned to me and</p>
<p>said, "You won't mind if there are a few students with the doctor, will</p>
<p>you?"  What could I say?  "Oh no," I said.  I walked in and found nine</p>
<p>pairs of eyes fixed on me.  Nine!  Eighteen separate eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Now, if that receptionist had told me there were going to be nine</p>
<p>people in that room, I'd have walked out on the spot.  But there I was,</p>
<p>and it was too late to do a thing about it.  Well, on this particular</p>
<p>day I happened to be wearing a fur coat...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'In August?</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, it was one of those cold, wet days, and I thought, my first</p>
<p>psychiatrist--you know.  Anyway, this psychiatrist kept eyeing that fur</p>
<p>coat the whole time I talked to him, and I could just see what he</p>
<p>thought of my asking to pay the student's cut-rate instead of the full</p>
<p>fee.  I could see the dollar signs in his eyes.  Well, I told him I</p>
<p>don't know whatall--about the bunions and the telephone in the drawer</p>
<p>and how I wanted to kill myself, and then he asked me to wait outside</p>
<p>while he discussed my case with the others, and when he called me back</p>
<p>in, you know what he said?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He folded his hands together and looked at me and said, "Miss Gilling,</p>
<p>we have decided that you would benefit by group therapy."'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'_Group_ therapy?'  I thought I must sound phoney as an echo chamber,</p>
<p>but Joan didn't pay any notice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's what he said.  Can you imagine me wanting to kill myself, and</p>
<p>coming round to chat about it with a whole pack of strangers, and most</p>
<p>of them no better than myself...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's crazy.'  I was growing involved in spite of myself.  'That's</p>
<p>not even _hu_man.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's just what I said.  I went straight home and wrote that doctor a</p>
<p>letter.  I wrote him one beautiful letter about how a man like that had</p>
<p>no business setting himself up to help sick people...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Did you get any answer?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't know.  That was the day I read about you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How do you mean?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh,' Joan said, 'about how the police thought you were dead and all.</p>
<p>I've got a pile of clippings somewhere.'  She heaved herself up, and I</p>
<p>had a strong horsey whiff that made my nostrils prickle.  Joan had been</p>
<p>a champion horse-jumper at the annual college gymkhana, and I wondered</p>
<p>if she had been sleeping in a stable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan rummaged in her open suitcase and came up with a fistful of</p>
<p>clippings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Here, have a look.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first clipping showed a big, blown-up picture of a girl with</p>
<p>black-shadowed eyes and black lips spread in a grin.  I couldn't</p>
<p>imagine where such a tarty picture had been taken until I noticed the</p>
<p>Bloomingdale ear-rings and the Bloomingdale necklace glinting out of it</p>
<p>with bright, white highlights, like imitation stars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SCHOLARSHIP GIRL MISSING.  MOTHER WORRIED.  The article under the</p>
<p>picture told how this girl had disappeared from her home on August</p>
<p>17th, wearing a green skirt and a white blouse, and had left a note</p>
<p>saying she was taking a long walk.  _When Miss Greenwood had not</p>
<p>returned by midnight_, it said, _her mother called the town police_.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next clipping showed a picture of my mother and brother and me</p>
<p>grouped together in our backyard and smiling.  I couldn't think who had</p>
<p>taken that picture either, until I saw I was wearing dungarees and</p>
<p>white sneakers and remembered that was what I wore in my</p>
<p>spinach-picking summer, and how Dodo Conway had dropped by and taken</p>
<p>some family snaps of the three of us one hot afternoon.  _Mrs Greenwood</p>
<p>asked that this picture be printed in hopes that it will encourage her</p>
<p>daughter to return home_.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>SLEEPING PILLS FEARED MISSING WITH GIRL.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A dark, midnight picture of about a dozen moon-faced people in a wood.</p>
<p>I thought the people at the end of the row looked queer and unusually</p>
<p>short until I realized they were not people, but dogs.  _Bloodhounds</p>
<p>used in search for missing girl.  Police Sgt Bill Hindly says: It</p>
<p>doesn't look good_.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>GIRL FOUND ALIVE!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The last picture showed policemen lifting a long, limp blanket roll</p>
<p>with a featureless cabbage head into the back of an ambulance.  Then it</p>
<p>told how my mother had been down in the cellar, doing the week's</p>
<p>laundry, when she heard faint groans coming from a disused hole...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I laid the clippings on the white spread of the bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You keep them,' Joan said.  'You ought to stick them in a scrapbook.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I folded the clippings and slipped them in my pocket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I read about you,' Joan went on.  'Not how they found you, but</p>
<p>everything up to that, and I put all my money together and took the</p>
<p>first plane to New York.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why New York?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I thought it would be easier to kill myself in New York.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What did you do?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan grinned sheepishly and stretched out her hands, palm up.  Like a</p>
<p>miniature mountain range, large, reddish weals upheaved across the</p>
<p>white flesh of her wrists.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How did you do that?'  For the first time it occurred to me Joan and I</p>
<p>might have something in common.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I shoved my fists through my room-mate's window.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What room-mate?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My old college room-mate.  She was working in New York, and I couldn't</p>
<p>think of anyplace else to stay, and besides, I'd hardly any money left,</p>
<p>so I went to stay with her.  My parents found me there--she'd written</p>
<p>them I was acting funny--and my father flew straight down and brought</p>
<p>me back.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But you're all right now.' I made it a statement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan considered me with her bright, pebble-grey eyes.  'I guess so,'</p>
<p>she said.  'Aren't you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had fallen asleep after the evening meal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was awakened by a loud voice.  _Mrs Bannister, Mrs Bannister, Mrs</p>
<p>Bannister, Mrs Bannister_.  As I pulled out of sleep, I found I was</p>
<p>beating on the bedpost with my hands and calling.  The sharp, wry</p>
<p>figure of Mrs Bannister, the night nurse, scurried into view.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Here, we don't want you to break this.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>She unfastened the band of my watch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What's the matter?  What happened?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Bannister's face twisted into a quick smile.  'You've had a</p>
<p>reaction.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A reaction?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes, how do you feel?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Funny.  Sort of light and airy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mrs Bannister helped me sit up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You'll be better now.  You'll be better in no time.  Would you like</p>
<p>some hot milk?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And when Mrs Bannister held the cup to my lips, I fanned the hot milk</p>
<p>out on my tongue as it went down, tasting it luxuriously, the way a</p>
<p>baby tastes its mother.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mrs Bannister tells me you had a reaction.'  Doctor Nolan seated</p>
<p>herself in the armchair by the window and took out a tiny box of</p>
<p>matches.  The box looked exactly like the one I had hidden in the hem</p>
<p>of my bathrobe, and for a moment I wondered if a nurse had discovered</p>
<p>it there and given it back to Doctor Nolan on the quiet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan scraped a match on the side of the box.  A hot yellow</p>
<p>flame jumped into life, and I watched her suck it up into the cigarette.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mrs B. says you felt better.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I did for a while.  Now I'm the same again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've news for you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I waited.  Every day now, for I didn't know how many days, I had spent</p>
<p>the mornings and afternoons and evenings wrapped up in my white blanket</p>
<p>on the deck chair in the alcove, pretending to read.  I had a dim</p>
<p>notion that Doctor Nolan was allowing me a certain number of days and</p>
<p>then she would say just what Doctor Gordon had said: 'I'm sorry, you</p>
<p>don't seem to have improved, I think you'd better have some shock</p>
<p>treatments...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, don't you want to hear what it is?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?' I said dully, and braced myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You're not to have any more visitors for a while.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared at Doctor Nolan in surprise.  'Why that's wonderful.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I thought you'd be pleased.'  She smiled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I looked, and Doctor Nolan looked, at the waste-basket beside my</p>
<p>bureau.  Out of the waste-basket poked the blood-red buds of a dozen</p>
<p>long-stemmed roses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That afternoon my mother had come to visit me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother was only one in a long stream of visitors--my former</p>
<p>employer, the lady Christian Scientist, who walked on the lawn with me</p>
<p>and talked about the mist going up from the earth in the Bible, and the</p>
<p>mist being error, and my whole trouble being that I believed in the</p>
<p>mist, and the minute I stopped believing in it, it would disappear and</p>
<p>I would see I had always been well, and the English teacher I had in</p>
<p>high school who came and tried to teach me how to play Scrabble,</p>
<p>because he thought it might revive my old interest in words, and</p>
<p>Philomena Guinea herself, who wasn't at all satisfied with what the</p>
<p>doctors were doing and kept telling them so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hated these visits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would be sitting in my alcove or in my room, and a smiling nurse</p>
<p>would pop in and announce one or another of the visitors.  Once they'd</p>
<p>even brought the minister of the Unitarian church, whom I'd never</p>
<p>really liked at all.  He was terribly nervous the whole time, and I</p>
<p>could tell he thought I was crazy as a loon, because I told him I</p>
<p>believed in hell, and that certain people, like me, had to live in hell</p>
<p>before they died, to make up for missing out on it after death, since</p>
<p>they didn't believe in life after death, and what each person believed</p>
<p>happened to him when he died.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hated these visits, because I kept feeling the visitors measuring my</p>
<p>fat and stringy hair against what I had been and what they wanted me to</p>
<p>be, and I knew they went away utterly confounded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought if they left me alone I might have some peace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother was the worst.  She never scolded me, but kept begging me,</p>
<p>with a sorrowful face, to tell her what she had done wrong.  She said</p>
<p>she was sure the doctors thought she had done something wrong because</p>
<p>they asked her a lot of questions about my toilet training, and I had</p>
<p>been perfectly trained at a very early age and given her no trouble</p>
<p>whatsoever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That afternoon my mother had brought me the roses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Save them for my funeral,' I'd said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mother's face puckered, and she looked ready to cry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But Esther, don't you remember what day it is today?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought it might be Saint Valentine's day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's your _birth_day.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that was when I had dumped the roses in the wastebasket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That was a silly thing for her to do,' I said to Doctor Nolan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan nodded.  She seemed to know what I meant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I hate her,' I said, and waited for the blow to fall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Doctor Nolan only smiled at me as if something had pleased her</p>
<p>very, very much, and said, 'I suppose you do.'</p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-17">
<h2>Chapter Seventeen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>'You're a lucky girl today.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The young nurse cleared my breakfast tray away and left me wrapped in</p>
<p>my white blanket like a passenger taking the sea air on the deck of a</p>
<p>ship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why am I lucky?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, I'm not sure if you're supposed to know yet, but today you're</p>
<p>moving to Belsize.'  The nurse looked at me expectantly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Belsize,' I said.  'I can't go there.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why not?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm not ready.  I'm not well enough.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course, you're well enough.  Don't worry, they wouldn't be moving</p>
<p>you if you weren't well enough.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the nurse left, I tried to puzzle out this new move on Doctor</p>
<p>Nolan's part.  What was she trying to prove?  I hadn't changed.</p>
<p>Nothing had changed.  And Belsize was the best house of all.  From</p>
<p>Belsize people went back to work and back to school and back to their</p>
<p>homes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan would be at Belsize.  Joan with her physics books and her golf</p>
<p>clubs and her badminton rackets and her breathy voice.  Joan, marking</p>
<p>the gulf between me and the nearly well ones.  Ever since Joan left</p>
<p>Caplan I'd followed her progress through the asylum grapevine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan had walk privileges, Joan had shopping privileges, Joan had town</p>
<p>privileges.  I gathered all my news of Joan into a little, bitter heap,</p>
<p>though I received it with surface gladness.  Joan was the beaming</p>
<p>double of my old best self, specially designed to follow and torment me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps Joan would be gone when I got to Belsize.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At least at Belsize I could forget about shock treatments.  At Caplan a</p>
<p>lot of the women had shock treatments.  I could tell which ones they</p>
<p>were, because they didn't get their breakfast trays with the rest of</p>
<p>us.  They had their shock treatments while we breakfasted in our rooms,</p>
<p>and then they came into the lounge, quiet and extinguished, led like</p>
<p>children by the nurses, and ate their breakfasts there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each morning, when I heard the nurse knock with my tray, an immense</p>
<p>relief flooded through me, because I knew I was out of danger for that</p>
<p>day.  I didn't see how Doctor Nolan could tell you went to sleep during</p>
<p>a shock treatment if she'd never had a shock treatment herself.  How</p>
<p>did she know the person didn't just _look_ as if he was asleep, while</p>
<p>all the time, inside, he was feeling the blue volts and the noise?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Piano music sounded from the end of the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At supper I had sat quietly, listening to the chatter of the Belsize</p>
<p>women.  They were all fashionably dressed and carefully made up, and</p>
<p>several of them were married.  Some of them had been shopping downtown,</p>
<p>and others had been out visiting with friends, and all during supper</p>
<p>they kept tossing back and forth these private jokes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'd call Jack,' a woman named DeeDee said, 'only I'm afraid he</p>
<p>wouldn't be home.  I know just where I could call him, though, and he'd</p>
<p>be in, all right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The short, spry blonde woman at my table laughed.  'I almost had Doctor</p>
<p>Loring where I wanted him today.'  She widened her starey blue eyes</p>
<p>like a little doll.  'I wouldn't mind trading old Percy in for a new</p>
<p>model.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the opposite end of the room, Joan was wolfing her spam and broiled</p>
<p>tomato with great appetite.  She seemed perfectly at home among these</p>
<p>women and treated me coolly, with a slight sneer, like a dim and</p>
<p>inferior acquaintance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had gone to bed right after supper, but then I heard the piano music</p>
<p>and pictured Joan and DeeDee and Loubelle, the blonde woman, and the</p>
<p>rest of them, laughing and gossiping about me in the living room behind</p>
<p>my back.  They would be saying how awful it was to have people like me</p>
<p>in Belsize and that I should be in Wymark instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to put a lid on their nasty talk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Draping my blanket loosely around my shoulders, like a stole, I</p>
<p>wandered down the hall toward the light and the gay noise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the rest of the evening I listened to DeeDee thump out some of her</p>
<p>own songs on the grand piano, while the other women sat round playing</p>
<p>bridge and chatting, just the way they would in a college dormitory,</p>
<p>only most of them were ten years over college age.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of them, a great, tall, grey-haired woman with a booming bass</p>
<p>voice, named Mrs Savage, had gone to Vassar.  I could tell right away</p>
<p>she was a society woman, because she talked about nothing but</p>
<p>d√©butantes.  It seemed she had two or three daughters, and that year</p>
<p>they were all going to be d√©butantes, only she had loused up their</p>
<p>d√©butante party by signing herself into the asylum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DeeDee had one song she called 'The Milkman' and everybody kept saying</p>
<p>she ought to get it published, it would be a hit.  First her hands</p>
<p>would clop out a little melody on the keys, like the hoofbeats of a</p>
<p>slow pony, and next another melody came in, like the milkman whistling,</p>
<p>and then the two melodies went on together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's very nice,' I said in a conversational voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan was leaning on one corner of the piano and leafing through a new</p>
<p>issue of some fashion magazine, and DeeDee smiled up at her as if the</p>
<p>two of them shared a secret.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, Esther,' Joan said then, holding up the magazine, 'isn't this you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>DeeDee stopped playing.  'Let me see.'  She took the magazine, peered</p>
<p>at the page Joan pointed to, and then glanced back at me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh no,' DeeDee said.  'Surely not.'  She looked at the magazine again,</p>
<p>then at me.  'Never!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, but it _is_ Esther, isn't it Esther?' Joan said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Loubelle and Mrs Savage drifted over, and pretending I knew what it was</p>
<p>all about, I moved to the piano with them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The magazine photograph showed a girl in a strapless evening dress of</p>
<p>fuzzy white stuff, grinning fit to split, with a whole lot of boys</p>
<p>bending in around her.  The girl was holding a glass full of a</p>
<p>transparent drink and seemed to have her eyes fixed over my shoulder on</p>
<p>something that stood behind me, a little to my left.  A faint breath</p>
<p>fanned the back of my neck.  I wheeled round.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The night nurse had come in, unnoticed, on her soft rubber soles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No kidding,' she said, 'is that really you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, it's not me.  Joan's quite mistaken.  It's somebody else.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, say it's you!' DeeDee cried.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I pretended I didn't hear her and turned away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Loubelle begged the nurse to make a fourth at bridge, and I drew</p>
<p>up a chair to watch, although I didn't know the first thing about</p>
<p>bridge, because I hadn't had time to pick it up at college, the way all</p>
<p>the wealthy girls did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stared at the flat poker-faces of the kings and jacks and queens and</p>
<p>listened to the nurse talking about her hard life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You ladies don't know what it is, holding down two jobs,' she said.</p>
<p>'Nights I'm over here, watching you....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Loubelle giggled.  'Oh, we're good.  We're the best of the lot, and you</p>
<p>know it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, _you're_ all right.'  The nurse passed round a packet of spearmint</p>
<p>gum, then unfolded a pink strap from its tinfoil wrapper herself.</p>
<p>'_You're_ all right, it's those boobies at the state place that worry</p>
<p>me off my feet.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you work in both places then?' I asked with sudden interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You bet.'  The nurse gave me a straight look, and I could see she</p>
<p>thought I had no business in Belsize at all.  'You wouldn't like it</p>
<p>over there one bit, Lady Jane.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I found it strange that the nurse should call me Lady Jane when she</p>
<p>knew what my name was perfectly well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why?' I persisted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, it's not a nice place, like this.  This is a regular country club.</p>
<p>Over there they've got nothing.  No OT to talk of, no walks....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why haven't they got walks?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Not enough em-ploy-ees.'  The nurse scooped in a trick and Loubelle</p>
<p>groaned.  'Believe me, ladies, when I collect enough do-re-mi to buy me</p>
<p>a car, I'm clearing out.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Will you clear out of here, too?' Joan wanted to know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You bet.  Only private cases from then on.  When I feel like it....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I'd stopped listening.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt the nurse had been instructed to show me my alternatives.</p>
<p>Either I got better, or I fell, down, down, like a burning, then</p>
<p>burnt-out star, from Belsize, to Caplan, to Wymark and finally, after</p>
<p>Doctor Nolan and Mrs Guinea had given me up, to the state place</p>
<p>next-door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I gathered my blanket round me and pushed back my chair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You cold?' the nurse demanded rudely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes,' I said, moving off down the hall.  'I'm frozen stiff.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I woke warm and placid in my white cocoon.  A shaft of pale, wintry</p>
<p>sunlight dazzled the mirror and the glasses on the bureau and the metal</p>
<p>doorknobs.  From across the hall came the early morning clatter of the</p>
<p>maids in the kitchen, preparing the breakfast trays.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I heard the nurse knock on the door next to mine, at the far end of the</p>
<p>hall.  Mrs Savage's sleepy voice boomed out, and the nurse went into</p>
<p>her with the jingling tray.  I thought, with a mild stir of pleasure,</p>
<p>of the steaming blue china coffee pitcher and the blue china breakfast</p>
<p>cup and the fat blue china cream jug with the white daisies on it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was beginning to resign myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I was going to fall, I would hang on to my small comforts, at least,</p>
<p>as long as I possibly could.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse rapped on my door and, without waiting for an answer, breezed</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a new nurse--they were always changing--with a lean,</p>
<p>sand-coloured face and sandy hair, and large freckles polka-dotting her</p>
<p>bony nose.  For some reason the sight of this nurse made me sick at</p>
<p>heart, and it was only as she strode across the room to snap up the</p>
<p>green blind that I realized part of her strangeness came from being</p>
<p>empty-handed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I opened my mouth to ask for my breakfast tray, but silenced myself</p>
<p>immediately.  The nurse would be mistaking me for somebody else.  New</p>
<p>nurses often did that.  Somebody in Belsize must be having shock</p>
<p>treatments, unknown to me, and the nurse had, quite understandably,</p>
<p>confused me with her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I waited until the nurse had made her little circuit of my room,</p>
<p>patting, straightening, arranging, and taken the next tray in to</p>
<p>Loubelle one door farther down the hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I shoved my feet into my slippers, dragging my blanket with me,</p>
<p>for the morning was bright, but very cold, and crossed quickly to the</p>
<p>kitchen.  The pink-uniformed maid was filling a row of blue china</p>
<p>coffee pitchers from a great, battered kettle on the stove.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked with love at the line-up of waiting trays--the white paper</p>
<p>napkins, folded in their crisp, isosceles triangles, each under the</p>
<p>anchor of its silver fork, the pale domes of the soft-boiled eggs in</p>
<p>the blue egg cups, the scalloped glass shells of orange marmalade.  All</p>
<p>I had to do was reach out and claim my tray, and the world would be</p>
<p>perfectly normal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'There's been a mistake,' I told the maid, leaning over the counter and</p>
<p>speaking in a low, confidential tone.  'The new nurse forgot to bring</p>
<p>in my breakfast tray today.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I managed a bright smile, to show there were no hard feelings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What's the name?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Greenwood.  Esther Greenwood.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Greenwood, Greenwood, Greenwood.'  The maid's warty index finger slid</p>
<p>down the list of names of the patients in Belsize tacked up on the</p>
<p>kitchen wall.  'Greenwood, no breakfast today.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I caught the rim of the counter with both hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'There must be a mistake.  Are you sure it's Greenwood?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Greenwood,' the maid said decisively as the nurse came in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse looked questioningly from me to the maid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Miss Greenwood wanted her tray,' the maid said, avoiding my eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh,' the nurse smiled at me, 'you'll be getting your tray later on</p>
<p>this morning, Miss Greenwood.  You...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I didn't wait to hear what the nurse said.  I strode blindly out</p>
<p>into the hall, not to my room, because that was where they would come</p>
<p>to get me, but to the alcove, greatly inferior to the alcove at Caplan,</p>
<p>but an alcove, nevertheless, in a quiet corner of the hall, where Joan</p>
<p>and Loubelle and DeeDee and Mrs Savage would not come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I curled up in the far corner of the alcove with the blanket over my</p>
<p>head.  It wasn't the shock treatment that struck me, so much as the</p>
<p>bare-faced treachery of Doctor Nolan.  I liked Doctor Nolan, I loved</p>
<p>her, I had given her my trust on a platter and told her everything, and</p>
<p>she had promised, faithfully, to warn me ahead of time if ever I had to</p>
<p>have another shock treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If she had told me the night before I would have lain awake all night,</p>
<p>of course, full of dread and foreboding, but by morning I would have</p>
<p>been composed and ready.  I would have gone down the hall between two</p>
<p>nurses, past DeeDee and Loubelle and Mrs Savage and Joan, with dignity,</p>
<p>like a person coolly resigned to execution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nurse bent over me and called my name.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pulled away and crouched farther into the corner.  The nurse</p>
<p>disappeared.  I knew she would return, in a minute, with two burly men</p>
<p>attendants, and they would bear me, howling and hitting, past the</p>
<p>smiling audience now gathered in the lounge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan put her arm around me and hugged me like a mother.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You said you'd _tell_ me!' I shouted at her through the dishevelled</p>
<p>blanket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But I _am_ telling you,' Doctor Nolan said.  'I've come specially</p>
<p>early to tell you, and I'm taking you over myself.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I peered at her through swollen lids.  'Why didn't you tell me last</p>
<p>night?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I only thought it would keep you awake.  If I'd known...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You _said_ you'd tell me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Listen, Esther,' Doctor Nolan said.  'I'm going over with you.  I'll</p>
<p>be there the whole time, so everything will happen right, the way I</p>
<p>promised.  I'll be there when you wake up, and I'll bring you back</p>
<p>again.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at her.  She seemed very upset.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I waited a minute.  Then I said, 'Promise you'll be there.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I promise.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan took out a white handkerchief and wiped my face.  Then she</p>
<p>hooked her arm in my arm, like an old friend, and helped me up, and we</p>
<p>started down the hall.  My blanket tangled about my feet, so I let it</p>
<p>drop, but Doctor Nolan didn't seem to notice.  We passed Joan, coming</p>
<p>out of her room, and I gave her a meaning, disdainful smile, and she</p>
<p>ducked back and waited until we had gone by.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Doctor Nolan unlocked a door at the end of the hall and led me</p>
<p>down a flight of stairs into the mysterious basement corridors that</p>
<p>linked, in an elaborate network of tunnels and burrows, all the various</p>
<p>buildings of the hospital.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The walls were bright, white lavatory tile with bald bulbs set at</p>
<p>intervals in the black ceiling.  Stretchers and wheelchairs were</p>
<p>beached here and there against the hissing, knocking pipes that ran and</p>
<p>branched in an intricate nervous system along the glittering walls.  I</p>
<p>hung on to Doctor Nolan's arm like death, and every so often she gave</p>
<p>me an encouraging squeeze.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we stopped at a green door with Electrotherapy printed on it</p>
<p>in black letters.  I held back, and Doctor Nolan waited.  Then I said,</p>
<p>'Let's get it over with,' and we went in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only people in the waiting-room beside Doctor Nolan and me were a</p>
<p>pallid man in a shabby maroon bathrobe and his accompanying nurse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you want to sit down?'  Doctor Nolan pointed at a wooden bench, but</p>
<p>my legs felt full of heaviness, and I thought how hard it would be to</p>
<p>hoist myself from a sitting position when the shock treatment people</p>
<p>came in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'd rather stand.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>At last a tall, cadaverous woman in a white smock entered the room from</p>
<p>an inner door.  I thought that she would go up and take the man in the</p>
<p>maroon bathrobe, as he was first, so I was surprised when she came</p>
<p>towards me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Good morning, Doctor Nolan,' the woman said, putting her arm around my</p>
<p>shoulders.  'Is this Esther?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes, Miss Huey.  Esther, this is Miss Huey, she'll take good care of</p>
<p>you.  I've told her about you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought the woman must be seven feet tall.  She bent over me in a</p>
<p>kind way, and I could see that her face, with the buck teeth protruding</p>
<p>in the centre, had at one time been badly pitted with acne.  It looked</p>
<p>like maps of the craters on the moon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I think we can take you right away, Esther,' Miss Huey said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mr Anderson won't mind waiting, will you, Mr Anderson?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Anderson didn't say a word, so with Miss Huey's arm around my</p>
<p>shoulder, and Doctor Nolan following, I moved into the next room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the slits of my eyes, which I didn't dare open too far, lest</p>
<p>the full view strike me dead, I saw the high bed with its white,</p>
<p>drumtight sheet, and the machine behind the bed, and the masked</p>
<p>person--I couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman--behind the</p>
<p>machine, and other masked people flanking the bed on both sides.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Miss Huey helped me climb up and lie down on my back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Talk to me,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Miss Huey began to talk in a low, soothing voice, smoothing the salve</p>
<p>on my temples and fitting the small electric buttons on either side of</p>
<p>my head.  'You'll be perfectly all right, you won't feel a thing, just</p>
<p>bite down....'  And she set something on my tongue and in panic I bit</p>
<p>down, and darkness wiped me out like chalk on a blackboard.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-18">
<h2>Chapter Eighteen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>'Esther.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I woke out of a deep, drenched sleep, and the first thing I saw was</p>
<p>Doctor Nolan's face swimming in front of me and saying, 'Esther,</p>
<p>Esther.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I rubbed my eyes with an awkward hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Behind Doctor Nolan I could see the body of a woman wearing a rumpled</p>
<p>black-and-white checked robe and flung out on a cot as if dropped from</p>
<p>a great height.  But before I could take in any more, Doctor Nolan led</p>
<p>me through a door into fresh, blue-skied air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the heat and fear had purged itself.  I felt surprisingly at peace.</p>
<p>The bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head.  I was open to</p>
<p>the circulating air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It was like I told you it would be, wasn't it?' said Doctor Nolan, as</p>
<p>we walked back to Belsize together through the crunch of brown leaves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well it will always be like that,' she said firmly.  'You will be</p>
<p>having shock treatments three times a week--Tuesday, Thursday and</p>
<p>Saturday.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I gulped in a long draught of air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'For how long?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That depends,' Doctor Nolan said, 'on you and me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I took up the silver knife and cracked off the cap of my egg.  Then I</p>
<p>put down the knife and looked at it.  I tried to think what I had loved</p>
<p>knives for, but my mind slipped from the noose of the thought and</p>
<p>swung, like a bird, in the centre of empty air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan and DeeDee were sitting side by side on the piano bench, and</p>
<p>DeeDee was teaching Joan to play the bottom half of Chopsticks while</p>
<p>she played the top.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought how sad it was Joan looked so horsey, with such big teeth and</p>
<p>eyes like two grey, goggly pebbles.  Why, she couldn't even keep a boy</p>
<p>like Buddy Willard.  And DeeDee's husband was obviously living with</p>
<p>some mistress or other and turning her sour as an old fusty cat.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've got a let-ter,' Joan chanted, poking her tousled head inside my</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Good for you.'  I kept my eyes on my book.  Ever since the shock</p>
<p>treatments had ended, after a brief series of five, and I had town</p>
<p>privileges, Joan hung about me like a large and breathless fruitfly--as</p>
<p>if the sweetness of recovery were something she could suck up by mere</p>
<p>nearness.  They had taken away her physics books and the piles of dusty</p>
<p>spiral pads full of lecture notes that had ringed her room, and she was</p>
<p>confined to grounds again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't you want to know who it's _from_?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan edged into the room and sat down on my bed.  I wanted to tell her</p>
<p>to get the hell out, she gave me the creeps, only I couldn't do it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'All right.'  I stuck my finger in my place and shut the book.  'Who</p>
<p>from?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan slipped out a pale blue envelope from her skirt pocket and waved</p>
<p>it teasingly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well isn't that a coincidence!' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you mean, a coincidence?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I went over to my bureau, picked up a pale blue envelope and waved it</p>
<p>at Joan like a parting handkerchief.  'I got a letter too.  I wonder if</p>
<p>they're the same.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He's better,' Joan said.  'He's out of hospital.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Are you going to marry him?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No,' I said.  'Are you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan grinned evasively.  'I didn't like him much, anyway.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, it was his family I liked.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You mean Mr and Mrs Willard?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes,' Joan's voice slid down my spine like a draft.  'I loved them.</p>
<p>They were so nice, so happy, nothing like my parents.  I went over to</p>
<p>see them all the time;' she paused, 'until you came.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm sorry.'  Then I added, 'Why didn't you go on seeing them, if you</p>
<p>liked them so much?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I couldn't,' Joan said.  'Not with you dating Buddy.  It would</p>
<p>have looked ... I don't _know_, funny.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I considered.  'I suppose so.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Are you,' Joan hesitated, 'going to let him come?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't know.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first I had thought it would be awful having Buddy come and visit me</p>
<p>at the asylum--he would probably only come to gloat and hob-nob with</p>
<p>the other doctors.  But then it seemed to me it would be a step,</p>
<p>placing him, renouncing him, in spite of the fact that I had</p>
<p>nobody--telling him there was no simultaneous interpreter, nobody, but</p>
<p>that he was the wrong one, that I had stopped hanging on.  'Are you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes,' Joan breathed.  'Maybe he'll bring his mother.  I'm going to ask</p>
<p>him to bring his mother....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'His _mother_?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan pouted.  'I like Mrs Willard.  Mrs Willard's a wonderful,</p>
<p>wonderful woman.  She's been a real mother to me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a picture of Mrs Willard, with her heather-mixture tweeds and her</p>
<p>sensible shoes and her wise, maternal maxims.  Mr Willard was her</p>
<p>little boy, and his voice was high and clear, like a little boy's.</p>
<p>Joan and Mrs Willard.  Joan ... and Mrs Willard...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had knocked on DeeDee's door that morning, wanting to borrow some</p>
<p>two-part sheet music.  I waited a few minutes and then, hearing no</p>
<p>answer and thinking DeeDee must be out, and I could pick up the music</p>
<p>from her bureau, I pushed the door open and stepped into the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Belsize, even at Belsize, the doors had locks, but the patients had</p>
<p>no keys.  A shut door meant privacy, and was respected, like a locked</p>
<p>door.  One knocked, and knocked again, then went away.  I remembered</p>
<p>this as I stood, my eyes half-useless after the brilliance of the hall,</p>
<p>in the room's deep, musky dark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As my vision cleared, I saw a shape rise from the bed.  Then somebody</p>
<p>gave a low giggle.  The shape adjusted its hair, and two pale, pebble</p>
<p>eyes regarded me through the gloom.  DeeDee lay back on the pillows,</p>
<p>bare-legged under her green wool dressing-gown, and watched me with a</p>
<p>little mocking smile.  A cigarette glowed between the fingers of her</p>
<p>right hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I just wanted...' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I know,' said DeeDee.  'The music.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Hello, Esther,' Joan said then, and her cornhusk voice made me want to</p>
<p>puke.  'Wait for me, Esther, I'll come play the bottom part with you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now Joan said stoutly, 'I never really liked Buddy Willard.  He thought</p>
<p>he knew everything.  He thought he knew everything about women....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at Joan.  In spite of the creepy feeling, and in spite of my</p>
<p>old, ingrained dislike, Joan fascinated me.  It was like observing a</p>
<p>Martian, or a particularly warty toad.  Her thoughts were not my</p>
<p>thoughts, nor her feelings my feelings, but we were close enough so</p>
<p>that her thoughts and feelings seemed a wry, black image of my own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes I wondered if I had made Joan up.  Other times I wondered if</p>
<p>she would continue to pop in at every crisis of my life to remind me of</p>
<p>what I had been, and what I had been through, and carry on her own</p>
<p>separate but similar crisis under my nose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I don't see what women see in other women,' I'd told Doctor Nolan in</p>
<p>my interview that noon.  'What does a woman see in a woman that she</p>
<p>can't see in a man?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan paused.  Then she said, 'Tenderness.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>That shut me up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I like you,' Joan was saying.  'I like you better than Buddy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And as she stretched out on my bed with a silly smile, I remembered a</p>
<p>minor scandal at our college dormitory when a fat, matronly-breasted</p>
<p>senior, homely as a grandmother and a pious Religion major, and a tall,</p>
<p>gawky freshman with a history of being deserted at an early hour in all</p>
<p>sorts of ingenious ways by her blind dates, started seeing too much of</p>
<p>each other.  They were always together, and once somebody had come upon</p>
<p>them embracing, the story went, in the fat girl's room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But what were they _doing_?' I had asked.  Whenever I thought about</p>
<p>men and men, and women and women, I could never really imagine what</p>
<p>they would be actually doing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh,' the spy had said, 'Milly was sitting on the chair and Theodora</p>
<p>was lying on the bed, and Milly was stroking Theodora's hair.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was disappointed.  I had thought I would have some revelation of</p>
<p>specific evil.  I wondered if all women did with other women was lie</p>
<p>and hug.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, the famous woman poet at my college lived with another</p>
<p>woman--a stumpy old Classical scholar with a cropped Dutch cut.  And</p>
<p>when I had told the poet I might well get married and have a pack of</p>
<p>children some day, she stared at me in horror.  'But what about your</p>
<p>_career_?' she had cried.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My head ached.  Why did I attract these weird old women?  There was the</p>
<p>famous poet, and Philomena Guinea, and Jay Cee, and the Christian</p>
<p>Scientist lady and lord knows who, and they all wanted to adopt me in</p>
<p>some way, and, for the price of their care and influence, have me</p>
<p>resemble them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I like you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That's tough, Joan,' I said, picking up my book.  'Because I don't</p>
<p>like you.  You make me puke, if you want to know.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And I walked out of the room, leaving Joan lying, lumpy as an old</p>
<p>horse, across my bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I waited for the doctor, wondering if I should bolt.  I knew what I was</p>
<p>doing was illegal--in Massachusetts, anyway, because the state was</p>
<p>cram-jam full of Catholics--but Doctor Nolan said this doctor was an</p>
<p>old friend of hers, and a wise man.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What's your appointment for?' the brisk, white-uniformed receptionist</p>
<p>wanted to know, ticking my name off on a notebook list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you mean, _for_?'  I hadn't thought anybody but the doctor</p>
<p>himself would ask me that, and the communal waiting-room was full of</p>
<p>other patients waiting for other doctors, most of them pregnant or with</p>
<p>babies, and I felt their eyes on my flat, virgin stomach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The receptionist glanced up at me, and I blushed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A fitting, isn't it?' she said kindly.  'I only wanted to make sure so</p>
<p>I'd know what to charge you.  Are you a student?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ye-es.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'That will only be half-price then.  Five dollars, instead of ten.</p>
<p>Shall I bill you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was about to give my home address, where I would probably be by the</p>
<p>time the bill arrived, but then I thought of my mother opening the bill</p>
<p>and seeing what it was for.  The only other address I had was the</p>
<p>innocuous box number which people used who didn't want to advertise the</p>
<p>fact they lived in an asylum.  But I thought the receptionist might</p>
<p>recognize the box number, so I said, 'I better pay now,' and peeled</p>
<p>five dollar notes off the roll in my pocketbook.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The five dollars was part of what Philomena Guinea had sent me as a</p>
<p>sort of get-well present.  I wondered what she would think if she knew</p>
<p>to what use her money was being put.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether she knew it or not, Philomena Guinea was buying my freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What I hate is the thought of being under a man's thumb,' I had told</p>
<p>Doctor Nolan.  'A man doesn't have a worry in the world, while I've got</p>
<p>a baby hanging over my head like a big stick, to keep me in line.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Would you act differently if you didn't have to worry about a baby?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes,' I said, 'but...' and I told Doctor Nolan about the married woman</p>
<p>lawyer and her Defence of Chastity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan waited until I was finished.  Then she burst out laughing.</p>
<p>'Propaganda!' she said, and scribbled the name and address of this</p>
<p>doctor on a prescription pad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I leafed nervously through an issue of _Baby Talk_.  The fat, bright</p>
<p>faces of babies beamed up at me, page after page--bald babies,</p>
<p>chocolate-coloured babies, Eisenhower-faced babies, babies rolling over</p>
<p>for the first time, babies reaching for rattles, babies eating their</p>
<p>first spoonful of solid food, babies doing all the little tricky things</p>
<p>it takes to grow up, step by step, into an anxious and unsettling world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I smelt a mingling of Pabulum and sour milk and salt-cod-stinky diapers</p>
<p>and felt sorrowful and tender.  How easy having babies seemed to the</p>
<p>women around me!  Why was I so unmaternal and apart?  Why couldn't I</p>
<p>dream of devoting myself to baby after fat puling baby like Dodo Conway?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I had to wait on a baby all day, I would go mad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at the baby in the lap of the woman opposite.  I had no idea</p>
<p>how old it was, I never did, with babies--for all I knew it could talk</p>
<p>a blue streak and had twenty teeth behind its pursed, pink lips.  It</p>
<p>held its little wobbly head up on its shoulders--it didn't seem to have</p>
<p>a neck--and observed me with a wise, Platonic expression.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The baby's mother smiled and smiled, holding that baby as if it were</p>
<p>the first wonder of the world.  I watched the mother and the baby for</p>
<p>some clue to their mutual satisfaction, but before I had discovered</p>
<p>anything, the doctor called me in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You'd like a fitting,' he said cheerfully, and I thought with relief</p>
<p>that he wasn't the sort of doctor to ask awkward questions.  I had</p>
<p>toyed with the idea of telling him I planned to be married to a sailor</p>
<p>as soon as his ship docked at the Charlestown Navy Yard, and the reason</p>
<p>I didn't have an engagement ring was because we were too poor, but at</p>
<p>the last moment I rejected that appealing story and simply said 'Yes'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I climbed up on the examination table, thinking: 'I am climbing to</p>
<p>freedom, freedom from fear, freedom from marrying the wrong person,</p>
<p>like Buddy Willard, just because of sex, freedom from the Florence</p>
<p>Crittenden Homes where all the poor girls go who should have been</p>
<p>fitted out like me, because what they did, they would do anyway,</p>
<p>regardless...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I rode back to the asylum with my box in the plain brown paper</p>
<p>wrapper on my lap I might have been Mrs Anybody coming back from a day</p>
<p>in town with a Schrafft's cake for her maiden aunt or a Filene's</p>
<p>Basement hat.  Gradually the suspicion that Catholics had X-ray eyes</p>
<p>diminished, and I grew easy.  I had done well by my shopping</p>
<p>privileges, I thought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was my own woman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next step was to find the proper sort of man.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-19">
<h2>Chapter Nineteen</h2>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm going to be a psychiatrist.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan spoke with her usual breathy enthusiasm.  We were drinking apple</p>
<p>cider in the Belsize lounge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh,' I said dryly, 'that's nice.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've had a long talk with Doctor Quinn, and she thinks it's perfectly</p>
<p>possible.'  Doctor Quinn was Joan's psychiatrist, a bright, shrewd,</p>
<p>single lady, and I often thought if I had been assigned to Doctor Quinn</p>
<p>I would be still in Caplan or, more probably, Wymark.  Doctor Quinn had</p>
<p>an abstract quality that appealed to Joan, but it gave me the polar</p>
<p>chills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan chattered on about Egos and Ids, and I turned my mind to something</p>
<p>else, to the brown, unwrapped package in my bottom drawer.  I never</p>
<p>talked about Egos and Ids with Doctor Nolan.  I didn't know just what I</p>
<p>talked about, really.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'... I'm going to live out, now.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tuned in on Joan then.  'Where?' I demanded, trying to hide my envy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan said my college would take me back for the second</p>
<p>semester, on her recommendation and Philomena Guinea's scholarship, but</p>
<p>as the doctors vetoed my living with my mother in the interim, I was</p>
<p>staying on at the asylum until the winter term began.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even so, I felt it unfair of Joan to beat me through the gates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where?' I persisted.  'They're not letting you live on your own, are</p>
<p>they?'  Joan had only that week been given town privileges again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh no, of course not.  I'm living in Cambridge with Nurse Kennedy.</p>
<p>Her room-mate's just got married, and she needs someone to share the</p>
<p>apartment.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Cheers.'  I raised my apple cider glass, and we clinked.  In spite of</p>
<p>my profound reservations, I thought I would always treasure Joan.  It</p>
<p>was as if we had been forced together by some overwhelming</p>
<p>circumstance, like war or plague, and shared a world of our own.  'When</p>
<p>are you leaving?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'On the first of the month.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Nice.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan grew wistful.  'You'll come visit me, won't you, Esther?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I thought, 'Not likely.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'It hurts,' I said.  'Is it supposed to hurt?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin didn't say anything.  Then he said, 'Sometimes it hurts.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had met Irwin on the steps of the Widener Library.  I was standing at</p>
<p>the top of the long flight, overlooking the red brick buildings that</p>
<p>walled the snow-filled quad and preparing to catch the trolley back to</p>
<p>the asylum, when a tall young man with a rather ugly and bespectacled,</p>
<p>but intelligent face, came up and said, 'Could you please tell me the</p>
<p>time?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I glanced at my watch.  'Five past four.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the man shifted his arms around the load of books he was carrying</p>
<p>before him like a dinner tray and revealed a bony wrist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why, you've a watch yourself!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The man looked ruefully at his watch.  He lifted it and shook it by his</p>
<p>ear.  'Doesn't work.' He smiled engagingly.  'Where are you going?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was about to say, 'Back to the asylum', but the man looked promising,</p>
<p>so I changed my mind.  'Home.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Would you like some coffee first?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hesitated.  I was due at the asylum for supper and I didn't want to</p>
<p>be late so close to being signed out of there for good.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'A very _small_ cup of coffee?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to practise my new, normal personality on this man who, in</p>
<p>the course of my hesitations, told me his name was Irwin and that he</p>
<p>was a very well-paid professor of mathematics, so I said, 'All right,'</p>
<p>and, matching my stride to Irwin's, strolled down the long,</p>
<p>ice-encrusted flight at his side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was only after seeing Irwin's study that I decided to seduce him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin lived in a murky, comfortable basement apartment in one of the</p>
<p>rundown streets of outer Cambridge and drove me there--for a beer, he</p>
<p>said--after three cups of bitter coffee in a student cafe.  We sat in</p>
<p>his study on stuffed brown leather chairs, surrounded by stacks of</p>
<p>dusty, incomprehensible books with huge formulas inset artistically on</p>
<p>the page like poems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While I was sipping my first glass of beer--I have never really cared</p>
<p>for cold beer in mid-winter, but I accepted the glass to have something</p>
<p>solid to hold on to--the doorbell rang.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin seemed embarrassed.  'I think it may be a lady.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin had a queer, old-world habit of calling women ladies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Fine, fine,' I gestured largely.  'Bring her in.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin shook his head.  'You would upset her.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I smiled into my amber cylinder of cold beer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The doorbell rang again with a peremptory jab.  Irwin sighed and rose</p>
<p>to answer it.  The minute he disappeared, I whipped into the bathroom</p>
<p>and, concealed behind the dirty, aluminium-coloured Venetian blind,</p>
<p>watched Irwin's monkish face appear in the door crack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A large, bosomy Slavic lady in a bulky sweater of natural sheep's wool,</p>
<p>purple slacks, high-heeled black overshoes with Persian lamb cuffs and</p>
<p>a matching toque, puffed white, inaudible words into the wintry air.</p>
<p>Irwin's voice drifted back to me through the chilly hall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm sorry, Olga ... I'm working, Olga ... no, I don't think so, Olga,'</p>
<p>all the while the lady's red mouth moved, and the words, translated to</p>
<p>white smoke, floated up among the branches of the naked Mac by the</p>
<p>door.  Then, finally, 'Perhaps, Olga ... good-bye, Olga.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I admired the immense, steppe-like expanse of the lady's wool-clad</p>
<p>bosom as she retreated, a few inches from my eye, down the creaking</p>
<p>wooden stair, a sort of Siberian bitterness on her vivid lips.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'I suppose you have lots and lots of affairs in Cambridge, I told Irwin</p>
<p>cheerily, as I stuck a snail with a pin in one of Cambridge's</p>
<p>determinedly French restaurants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I seem,' Irwin admitted with a small, modest smile, 'to get on with</p>
<p>the ladies.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I picked up my empty snail shell and drank the herb-green juice.  I had</p>
<p>no idea if this was proper, but after months of wholesome, dull asylum</p>
<p>diet, I was greedy for butter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had called Doctor Nolan from a pay phone at the restaurant and asked</p>
<p>for permission to stay overnight in Cambridge with Joan.  Of course, I</p>
<p>had no idea whether Irwin would invite me back to his apartment after</p>
<p>dinner or not, but I thought his dismissal of the Slavic lady--another</p>
<p>professor's wife--looked promising.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tipped back my head and poured down a glass of Nuits St. George.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You do like wine,' Irwin observed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Only Nuits St. George.  I imagine him ... with the dragon...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin reached for my hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt the first man I slept with must be intelligent, so I would</p>
<p>respect him.  Irwin was a full professor at twenty-six and had the</p>
<p>pale, hairless skin of a boy genius.  I also needed somebody quite</p>
<p>experienced to make up for my lack of it, and Irwin's ladies reassured</p>
<p>me on this head.  Then, to be on the safe side, I wanted somebody I</p>
<p>didn't know and wouldn't go on knowing--a kind of impersonal,</p>
<p>priestlike official, as in the tales of tribal rites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By the end of the evening I had no doubts about Irwin whatsoever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ever since I'd learned about the corruption of Buddy Willard my</p>
<p>virginity weighed like a millstone around my neck.  It had been of such</p>
<p>enormous importance to me for so long that my habit was to defend it at</p>
<p>all costs.  I had been defending it for five years and I was sick of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was only as Irwin swung me into his arms, back at the apartment, and</p>
<p>carried me, wine-dazed and limp, into the pitch-black bedroom, that I</p>
<p>murmured, 'You know, Irwin, I think I ought to tell you, I'm a virgin.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin laughed and flung me down on the bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A few minutes later an exclamation of surprise revealed that Irwin</p>
<p>hadn't really believed me.  I thought how lucky it was I had started</p>
<p>practising birth control during the day, because in my winey state that</p>
<p>night I would never have bothered to perform the delicate and necessary</p>
<p>operation.  I lay, rapt and naked, on Irwin's rough blanket, waiting</p>
<p>for the miraculous change to make itself felt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But all I felt was a sharp, startlingly bad pain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It hurts,' I said.  'Is it supposed to hurt?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin didn't say anything.  Then he said, 'Sometimes it hurts.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a little while Irwin got up and went into the bathroom, and I</p>
<p>heard the rushing of shower water.  I wasn't sure if Irwin had done</p>
<p>what he planned to do, or if my virginity had obstructed him in some</p>
<p>way.  I wanted to ask him if I was still a virgin, but I felt too</p>
<p>unsettled.  A warm liquid was seeping out between my legs.</p>
<p>Tentatively, I reached down and touched it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I held my hand up to the light streaming in from the bathroom, my</p>
<p>fingertips looked black.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Irwin,' I said nervously, 'bring me a towel.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin strolled back, a bathtowel knotted around his waist, and tossed</p>
<p>me a second, smaller towel.  I pushed the towel between my legs and</p>
<p>pulled it away almost immediately.  It was half black with blood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm bleeding!' I announced, sitting up with a start.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, that often happens,' Irwin reassured me.  'You'll be all right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the stories of blood-stained bridal sheets and capsules of red ink</p>
<p>bestowed on already deflowered brides floated back to me.  I wondered</p>
<p>how much I would bleed, and lay down, nursing the towel.  It occurred</p>
<p>to me that the blood was my answer.  I couldn't possibly be a virgin</p>
<p>any more.  I smiled into the dark.  I felt part of a great tradition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Surreptitiously, I applied a fresh section of white towel to my wound,</p>
<p>thinking that as soon as the bleeding stopped, I would take the late</p>
<p>trolley back to the asylum.  I wanted to brood over my new condition in</p>
<p>perfect peace.  But the towel came away black and dripping.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I ... think I better go home,' I said faintly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Surely not so soon.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes, I think I better.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I asked if I could borrow Irwin's towel and packed it between my thighs</p>
<p>as a bandage.  Then I pulled on my sweaty clothes.  Irwin offered to</p>
<p>drive me home, but I didn't see how I could let him drive me to the</p>
<p>asylum, so I dug in my pocketbook for Joan's address.  Irwin knew the</p>
<p>street and went out to start the car.  I was too worried to tell him I</p>
<p>was still bleeding.  I kept hoping every minute that it would stop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But as Irwin drove me through the barren, snow-banked streets I felt</p>
<p>the warm seepage let itself through the dam of the towel and my skirt</p>
<p>and on to the car seat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we slowed, cruising by house after lit house, I thought how</p>
<p>fortunate it was I had not discarded my virginity while living at</p>
<p>college or at home, where such concealment would have been impossible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan opened the door with an expression of glad surprise.  Irwin kissed</p>
<p>my hand and told Joan to take good care of me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shut the door and leaned back against it, feeling the blood drain</p>
<p>from my face in one spectacular flush.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why, Esther,' Joan said, 'what on earth's the matter?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wondered when Joan would notice the blood trickling down my legs and</p>
<p>oozing, stickily, into each black patent leather shoe.  I thought I</p>
<p>could be dying from a bullet wound and Joan would still stare through</p>
<p>me with her blank eyes, expecting me to ask for a cup of coffee and a</p>
<p>sandwich.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Is that nurse here?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, she's on night duty at Caplan....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Good.'  I made a little bitter grin as another soak of blood let</p>
<p>itself through the drenched padding and started the tedious journey</p>
<p>into my shoes.  'I mean ... bad.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You look funny,' Joan said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You better get a doctor.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Quick.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still she hadn't noticed anything.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I bent down, with a brief grunt, and slipped off one of my</p>
<p>winter-cracked black Bloomingdale shoes.  I held the shoe up, before</p>
<p>Joan's enlarged, pebbly eyes, tilted it, and watched her take in the</p>
<p>stream of blood that cascaded on to the beige rug.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'My God!  What is it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm h√¶morrhaging.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan half-led, half-dragged me to the sofa and made me lie down.  Then</p>
<p>she propped some pillows under my blood-stained feet.  Then she stood</p>
<p>back and demanded, 'Who was that man?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>For one crazy minute I thought Joan would refuse to call a doctor until</p>
<p>I confessed the whole story of my evening with Irwin and that after my</p>
<p>confession she would still refuse, as a sort of punishment.  But then I</p>
<p>realized that she honestly took my explanation at face value, that my</p>
<p>going to bed with Irwin was utterly incomprehensible to her, and his</p>
<p>appearance a mere prick to her pleasure at my arrival.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh somebody,' I said, with a flabby gesture of dismissal.  Another</p>
<p>pulse of blood released itself and I contracted my stomach muscles in</p>
<p>alarm.  'Get a towel.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan went out and came back almost immediately with a pile of towels</p>
<p>and sheets.  Like a prompt nurse, she peeled back my blood-wet clothes,</p>
<p>drew a quick breath as she arrived at the original royal red towel, and</p>
<p>applied a fresh bandage.  I lay, trying to slow the beating of my</p>
<p>heart, as every beat pushed forth another gush of blood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remembered a worrisome course in the Victorian novel where woman</p>
<p>after woman died, palely and nobly, in torrents of blood, after a</p>
<p>difficult childbirth.  Perhaps Irwin had injured me in some awful,</p>
<p>obscure way, and all the while I lay there on Joan's sofa I was really</p>
<p>dying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan pulled up an Indian hassock and began to dial down the long list</p>
<p>of Cambridge doctors.  The first number didn't answer.  Joan began to</p>
<p>explain my case to the second number, which did answer, but then broke</p>
<p>off and said 'I see' and hung up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What's the trouble?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'He'll only come for regular customers or emergencies.  It's Sunday.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to lift my arm and look at my watch, but my hand was a rock at</p>
<p>my side and wouldn't budge.  Sunday--the doctor's paradise!  Doctors at</p>
<p>country clubs, doctors at the seaside, doctors with mistresses, doctors</p>
<p>with wives, doctors in church, doctors in yachts, doctors everywhere</p>
<p>resolutely being people, not doctors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'For God's sake,' I said, 'tell them I'm an emergency.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The third number didn't answer and, at the fourth, the party hung up</p>
<p>the minute Joan mentioned it was about a period.  Joan began to cry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Look, Joan,' I said painstakingly, 'call up the local hospital.  Tell</p>
<p>them it's an emergency.  They'll have to take me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan brightened and dialled a fifth number.  The Emergency Service</p>
<p>promised her a staff doctor would attend to me if I could come in to</p>
<p>the ward.  Then Joan called a taxi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan insisted on riding with me.  I clasped my fresh padding of towels</p>
<p>with a sort of desperation as the cabby, impressed by the address Joan</p>
<p>gave him, cut corner after corner in the dawn-pale streets and drew up</p>
<p>with a great squeal of tyres at the Emergency Ward entrance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I left Joan to pay the driver and hurried into the empty, glaringly lit</p>
<p>room.  A nurse bustled out from behind a white screen.  In a few swift</p>
<p>words, I managed to tell her the truth about my predicament before Joan</p>
<p>came in the door, blinking and wide-eyed as a myopic owl.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Emergency Ward doctor strolled out then, and I climbed, with the</p>
<p>nurse's help, on to the examining table.  The nurse whispered to the</p>
<p>doctor, and the doctor nodded and began unpacking the bloody towelling.</p>
<p>I felt his fingers start to probe, and Joan stood, rigid as a soldier,</p>
<p>at my side, holding my hand, for my sake or hers I couldn't tell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Ouch!' I winced at a particularly bad jab.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The doctor whistled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You're one in a million.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What do you mean?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I mean it's one in a million it happens to like this.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The doctor spoke in a low, curt voice to the nurse, and she hurried to</p>
<p>a side table and brought back some rolls of gauze and silver</p>
<p>instruments.  'I can see,' the doctor bent down, 'exactly where the</p>
<p>trouble is coming from.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'But can you fix it?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The doctor laughed.  'Oh, I can fix it, all right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I was roused by a tap on my door.  It was past midnight, and the asylum</p>
<p>quiet as death.  I couldn't imagine who would still be up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Come in!' I switched on the bedside light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The door clicked open, and Doctor Quinn's brisk, dark head appeared in</p>
<p>the crack.  I looked at her with surprise, because although I knew who</p>
<p>she was, and often passed her, with a brief nod, in the asylum hall, I</p>
<p>never spoke to her at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now she said, 'Miss Greenwood, may I come in a minute?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn stepped into the room, shutting the door quietly behind</p>
<p>her.  She was wearing one of her navy blue, immaculate suits with a</p>
<p>plain, snow-white blouse showing in the V of the neck.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Greenwood, and especially at this time</p>
<p>of night, but I thought you might be able to help us out about Joan.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a minute I wondered if Doctor Quinn was going to blame me for</p>
<p>Joan's return to the asylum.  I still wasn't sure how much Joan knew,</p>
<p>after our trip to the Emergency Ward, but a few days later she had come</p>
<p>back to live in Belsize, retaining, however, the freest of town</p>
<p>privileges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll do what I can,' I told Doctor Quinn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn sat down on the edge of my bed with a grave face.  'We</p>
<p>would like to find out where Joan is.  We thought you might have an</p>
<p>idea.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly I wanted to dissociate myself from Joan completely.  'I don't</p>
<p>know,' I said coldly.  'Isn't she in her room?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was well after the Belsize curfew hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'No, Joan had a permit to go to a movie in town this evening, and she's</p>
<p>not back yet.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Who was she with?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She was alone.'  Doctor Quinn paused.  'Have you any idea where she</p>
<p>might be likely to spend the night?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Surely she'll be back.  Something must have held her up.'  But I</p>
<p>didn't see what could have held Joan up in tame night Boston.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn shook her head.  'The last trolley went by an hour ago.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Maybe she'll come back by taxi.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn sighed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Have you tried the Kennedy girl?' I went on.  'Where Joan used to</p>
<p>live?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn nodded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Her family?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, she'd never go there ... but we've tried them, too.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn lingered a minute, as if she could sniff out some clue in</p>
<p>the still room.  Then she said, 'Well, we'll do what we can,' and left.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I turned out the light and tried to drop back to sleep, but Joan's face</p>
<p>floated before me, bodiless and smiling, like the face of the Cheshire</p>
<p>cat.  I even thought I heard her voice, rustling and hushing through</p>
<p>the dark, but then I realized it was only the night wind in the asylum</p>
<p>trees....</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another tap woke me in the frost-grey dawn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This time I opened the door myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Facing me was Doctor Quinn.  She stood at attention, like a frail drill</p>
<p>sergeant, but her outlines seemed curiously smudged.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I thought you should know,' Doctor Quinn said.  'Joan has been found.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Quinn's use of the passive slowed my blood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Where?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'In the woods, by the frozen ponds....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I opened my mouth, but no words came out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'One of the orderlies found her,' Doctor Quinn continued, just now,</p>
<p>coming to work....'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'She's not...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Dead,' said Doctor Quinn.  'I'm afraid she's hanged herself.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds--not a Christmas</p>
<p>sprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort that snuffs out</p>
<p>schools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a</p>
<p>pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a week, if I passed my interview with the board of doctors,</p>
<p>Philomena Guinea's large black car would drive me west and deposit me</p>
<p>at the wrought-iron gates of my college.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The heart of winter!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Massachusetts would be sunk in a marble calm.  I pictured the</p>
<p>snowflakey, Grandma Moses villages, the reaches of swampland rattling</p>
<p>with dried cat-tails, the ponds where frog and hornpout dreamed in a</p>
<p>sheath of ice, and the shivering woods.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But under the deceptively clean and level slate the topography was the</p>
<p>same, and instead of San Francisco or Europe or Mars I would be</p>
<p>learning the old landscape, brook and hill and tree.  In one way it</p>
<p>seemed a small thing, starting, after a six months' lapse, where I had</p>
<p>so vehemently left off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everybody would know about me, of course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Doctor Nolan had said, quite bluntly, that a lot of people would treat</p>
<p>me gingerly, or even avoid me, like a leper with a warning bell.  My</p>
<p>mother's face floated to mind, a pale, reproachful moon, at her last</p>
<p>and first visit to the asylum since my twentieth birthday.  A daughter</p>
<p>in an asylum!  I had done that to her.  Still, she had obviously</p>
<p>decided to forgive me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'We'll take up where we left off, Esther,' she had said, with her</p>
<p>sweet, martyr's smile.  'We'll act as if all this were a bad dream.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>A bad dream.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the</p>
<p>world itself is the bad dream.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A bad dream.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remembered everything.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remembered the cadavers and Doreen and the story of the fig-tree and</p>
<p>Marco's diamond and the sailor on the Common and Doctor Gordon's</p>
<p>wall-eyed nurse and the broken thermometers and the negro with his two</p>
<p>kinds of beans and the twenty pounds I gained on insulin and the rock</p>
<p>that bulged between sky and sea like a grey skull.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe forgetfulness, like a kind snow, should numb and cover them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But they were part of me.  They were my landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'A man to see you!'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The smiling, snow-capped nurse poked her head in through the door, and</p>
<p>for a confused second I thought I really was back in college and this</p>
<p>spruce white furniture, this white view over trees and hills, an</p>
<p>improvement on my old room's nicked chairs and desk and outlook over</p>
<p>the bald quad.  'A man to see you!' the girl on watch had said, on the</p>
<p>dormitory phone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What was there about us, in Belsize, so different from the girls</p>
<p>playing bridge and gossiping and studying in the college to which I</p>
<p>would return?  Those girls, too, sat under bell jars of a sort.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Come in!' I called, and Buddy Willard, khaki cap in hand, stepped into</p>
<p>the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, Buddy,' I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well, Esther.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>We stood there, looking at each other.  I waited for a touch of</p>
<p>emotion, the faintest glow.  Nothing.  Nothing but a great, amiable</p>
<p>boredom.  Buddy's khaki-jacketed shape seemed small and unrelated to me</p>
<p>as the brown posts he had stood against that day a year ago, at the</p>
<p>bottom of the ski run.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'How did you get here?' I asked finally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Mother's car.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'In all this snow?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well,' Buddy grinned, 'I'm stuck outside in a drift.  The hill was too</p>
<p>much for me.  Is there anyplace I can borrow a shovel?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'We can get a shovel from one of the groundsmen.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Good.'  Buddy turned to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Wait, I'll come and help you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddy looked at me then, and in his eyes I saw a flicker of</p>
<p>strangeness--the same compound of curiosity and wariness I had seen in</p>
<p>the eyes of the Christian Scientist and my old English teacher and the</p>
<p>Unitarian minister who used to visit me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, Buddy,' I laughed.  'I'm all right.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Oh, I know, I know, Esther,' Buddy said hastily.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's you who oughtn't to dig out cars, Buddy.  Not me.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And Buddy did let me do most of the work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The car had skidded on the glassy hill up to the asylum and backed,</p>
<p>with one wheel over the rim of the drive, into a steep drift.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sun, emerged from its grey shrouds of cloud, shone with a summer</p>
<p>brilliance on the untouched slopes.  Pausing in my work to overlook</p>
<p>that pristine expanse, I felt the same profound thrill it gives me to</p>
<p>see trees and grassland waist-high under flood water--as if the usual</p>
<p>order of the world had shifted slightly, and entered a new phase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was grateful for the car and the snowdrift.  It kept Buddy from</p>
<p>asking me what I knew he was going to ask, and what he finally did ask,</p>
<p>in a low, nervous voice, at the Belsize afternoon tea.  DeeDee was</p>
<p>eyeing us like an envious cat over the rim of her teacup.  After Joan's</p>
<p>death, DeeDee had been moved to Wymark for a while, but now she was</p>
<p>among us once more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've been wondering ...'  Buddy set his cup in the saucer with an</p>
<p>awkward clatter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What have you been wondering?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I've been wondering ... I mean, I thought you might be able to tell me</p>
<p>something.'  Buddy met my eyes and I saw, for the first time, how he</p>
<p>had changed.  Instead of the old, sure smile that flashed on easily and</p>
<p>frequently as a photographer's bulb, his face was grave, even</p>
<p>tentative--the face of a man who often does not get what he wants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll tell you if I can, Buddy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you think there's something in me that _drives_ women crazy?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't help myself, I burst out laughing--maybe because of the</p>
<p>seriousness of Buddy's face and the common meaning of the word 'crazy'</p>
<p>in a sentence like that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I mean,' Buddy pushed on, 'I dated Joan, and then you, and first you</p>
<p>... went, and then Joan...'</p>
<p></p>
<p>With one finger I nudged a cake crumb into a drop of wet, brown tea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Of course you didn't do it!' I heard Doctor Nolan say.  I had come to</p>
<p>her about Joan, and it was the only time I remember her sounding angry.</p>
<p>'Nobody did it!  _She_ did it!'  And then Doctor Nolan told me how the</p>
<p>best of psychiatrists have suicides among their patients, and how they,</p>
<p>if anybody, should be held responsible, but how they, on the contrary,</p>
<p>do not hold themselves responsible....</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You had nothing to do with us, Buddy.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You're sure?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Absolutely.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Well,' Buddy breathed.  'I'm glad of that.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And he drained his tea like a tonic medicine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'I hear you're leaving us.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I fell into step beside Valerie in the little, nurse-supervised group.</p>
<p>'Only if the doctors say yes.  I have my interview tomorrow.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The packed snow creaked underfoot, and everywhere I could hear a</p>
<p>musical trickle and drip as the noon sun thawed icicles and snow crusts</p>
<p>that would glaze again before nightfall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The shadows of the massed black pines were lavender in that bright</p>
<p>light, and I walked with Valerie a while, down the familiar labyrinth</p>
<p>of shovelled asylum paths.  Doctors and nurses and patients passing on</p>
<p>adjoining paths seemed to be moving on casters, cut off at the waist by</p>
<p>the piled snow.  'Interviews!' Valerie snorted.  'They're nothing!  If</p>
<p>they're going to let you out, they let you out.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I hope so.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>In front of Caplan I said good-bye to Valerie's calm, snow-maiden face</p>
<p>behind which so little, bad or good, could happen, and walked on alone,</p>
<p>my breath coming in white puffs even in that sun-filled air.  Valerie's</p>
<p>last, cheerful cry had been 'So long!  Be seeing you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Not if I know it,' I thought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I wasn't sure.  I wasn't sure at all.  How did I know that</p>
<p>someday--at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere--the bell jar, with</p>
<p>its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?</p>
<p></p>
<p>And hadn't Buddy said, as if to revenge himself for my digging out the</p>
<p>car and his having to stand by, 'I wonder who you'll marry now, Esther.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'What?' I'd said, shovelling snow up on to a mound and blinking against</p>
<p>the stinging back-shower of loose flakes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I wonder who you'll marry now, Esther.  Now you've been,' and Buddy's</p>
<p>gesture encompassed the hill, the pines and the severe, snow-gabled</p>
<p>buildings breaking up the rolling landscape, 'here.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>And of course I didn't know who would marry me now that I'd been where</p>
<p>I had been.  I didn't know at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>'I have a bill here, Irwin.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I spoke quietly into the mouthpiece of the asylum pay phone in the main</p>
<p>hall of the administration building.  At first I suspected the</p>
<p>operator, at her switchboard, might be listening, but she just went on</p>
<p>plugging and unplugging her little tubes without batting an eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes,' Irwin said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'It's a bill for twenty dollars for emergency attention on a certain</p>
<p>date in December and a check-up a week thereafter.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Yes,' Irwin said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'The hospital says they are sending me the bill because there was no</p>
<p>answer to the bill they sent to you.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'All right, all right, I'm writing a cheque now.  I'm writing them a</p>
<p>blank cheque.'  Irwin's voice altered subtly.  'When am I going to see</p>
<p>you?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Do you really want to know?'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Very much.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Never,' I said, and hung up with a resolute click.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wondered, briefly, if Irwin would send his cheque to the hospital</p>
<p>after that, and then I thought, 'Of course he will, he's a mathematics</p>
<p>professor--he won't want to leave any loose ends.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt unaccountably weak-kneed and relieved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Irwin's voice had meant nothing to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the first time, since our first and last meeting, that I had</p>
<p>spoken with him and, I was reasonably sure, it would be the last.</p>
<p>Irwin had absolutely no way of getting in touch with me, except by</p>
<p>going to Nurse Kennedy's flat, and after Joan's death Nurse Kennedy had</p>
<p>moved somewhere else and left no trace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was perfectly free.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Joan's parents invited me to the funeral.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had been, Mrs Gilling said, one of Joan's best friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'You don't have to go, you know,' Doctor Nolan told me.  'You can</p>
<p>always write and say I said it would be better not to.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>'I'll go,' I said, and I did go, and all during the simple funeral</p>
<p>service I wondered what I thought I was burying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the altar the coffin loomed in its snow-pallor of flowers--the black</p>
<p>shadow of something that wasn't there.  The faces in the pews around me</p>
<p>were waxen with candlelight, and pine boughs, left over from Christmas,</p>
<p>sent up a sepulchral incense in the cold air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beside me, Jody's cheeks bloomed like good apples, and here and there</p>
<p>in the little congregation I recognized other faces of other girls from</p>
<p>college and my home town who had known Joan.  DeeDee and Nurse Kennedy</p>
<p>bent their kerchiefed heads in a front pew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, behind the coffin and the flowers and the face of the minister</p>
<p>and the faces of the mourners, I saw the rolling lawns of our town</p>
<p>cemetery, knee-deep in snow now, with the tombstones rising out of it</p>
<p>like smokeless chimneys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There would be a black, six-foot deep gap hacked in the hard ground.</p>
<p>That shadow would marry this shadow, and the peculiar, yellowish soil</p>
<p>of our locality seal the wound in the whiteness, and yet another</p>
<p>snowfall erase the traces of newness in Joan's grave.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am, I am, I am.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The doctors were having their weekly board meeting--old business, new</p>
<p>business, admissions, dismissals and interviews.  Leafing blindly</p>
<p>through a tatty _National Geographic_ in the asylum library, I waited</p>
<p>my turn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients, with accompanying nurses, made their rounds of the stocked</p>
<p>shelves, conversing, in low tones, with the asylum librarian, an alumna</p>
<p>of the asylum herself.  Glancing at her--myopic, spinsterish,</p>
<p>effaced--I wondered how she knew she had really graduated at all, and,</p>
<p>unlike her clients, was whole and well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Don't be scared,' Doctor Nolan had said.  'I'll be there, and the rest</p>
<p>of the doctors you know, and some visitors, and Doctor Vining, the head</p>
<p>of all the doctors, will ask you a few questions, and then you can go.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>But in spite of Doctor Nolan's reassurances, I was scared to death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had hoped, at my departure, I would feel sure and knowledgeable about</p>
<p>everything that lay ahead--after all, I had been 'analyzed'.  Instead,</p>
<p>all I could see were question marks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I kept shooting impatient glances at the closed boardroom door.  My</p>
<p>stocking seams were straight, my black shoes cracked, but polished, and</p>
<p>my red wool suit flamboyant as my plans.  Something old, something</p>
<p>new....</p>
<p></p>
<p>But I wasn't getting married.  There ought, I thought, to be a ritual</p>
<p>for being born twice--patched, retreaded and approved for the road.  I</p>
<p>was trying to think of an appropriate one when Doctor Nolan appeared</p>
<p>from nowhere and touched me on the shoulder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>'All right, Esther.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>I rose and followed her to the open door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pausing, for a brief breath, on the threshold, I saw the silver-baked</p>
<p>doctor who had told me about the rivers and the Pilgrims on my first</p>
<p>day, and the pocked, cadaverous face of Miss Huey, and eyes I thought I</p>
<p>had recognized over white masks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The eyes and the faces all turned themselves towards me, and guiding</p>
<p>myself by them, as by a magical thread, I stepped into the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
